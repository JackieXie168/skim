General Developer Info

	Skim is written in Objective-C with the Cocoa libraries. In particular, it makes use of the PDFKit framework to do much of the PDF rendering.
	In order to contribute to the main programming, a basic knowledge of Cocoa programming and Objective-C is necessary.
	There are currently few formal procedures for code review or coding standards. Most suggestions for improvement are expected to be discussed on the developer list before committing.


Subversion Repository Info

	All The source code necessary to build Skim is available in Subversion. There is a separate page on how to use the Skim Subversion Repository.


Building Skim

	Once you have downloaded the source, you can build Skim using Xcode. Xcode 3.2.6 or higher is required.*

		1. Open Skim.xcodeproj
		2. Build the Skim target:
			1. Select Project > "Set Active Target" > Skim
			2. Select Project > "Set Active Build Configuration" > Release, or if you want to debug (and who doesn't?), select Debug
			3. Select Build > Build

* It is possible to use older versions of Xcode, but due to bugs in Xcode special precautions are required to make sure that the dependencies build using the correct configuration. Using Xcode 2.5 and earlier requires editing the build settings, Skim target, and some source.


Localization
