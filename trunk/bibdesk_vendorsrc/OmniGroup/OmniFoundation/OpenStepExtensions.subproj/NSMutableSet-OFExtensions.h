- (void) removeObjectsFromArray: (NSArray *) objects;

Removes all objects from the receiver which are in the specified array.

/*"
Modifies the receiver to contain only those objects in the receiver or the argument but not the objects originally in both sets. The odd name is for parallelism with Apple's -intersectSet:, -unionSet:, etc.
