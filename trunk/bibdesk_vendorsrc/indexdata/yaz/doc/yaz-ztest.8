.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
 \fByaz\-ztest\fR is a Z39\&.50 test server that uses the YAZ generic frontend server API\&. The server acts as a real Z39\&.50 server but does not use a database\&. It returns a random hit count and returns a subset of a few built\-in records\&.

.PP
The \fIlistener\-spec\fR consists of a transport mode followed by a colon, followed by a listener address\&. The transport mode is either tcp, unix, or ssl\&.

.PP
For TCP and SSL, an address has the form: 

.IP

    hostname | IP\-number [ : portnumber ]
    

.PP
For UNIX local socket the address is the filename of the local socket\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-a \fIfile\fR
Specify a file for dumping PDUs (for diagnostic purposes)\&. The special name \- (dash) sends output to stderr\&.

.TP
\-S
Don't fork or make threads on connection requests\&. This is good for debugging, but not recommended for real operation: Although the server is asynchronous and non\-blocking, it can be nice to keep a software malfunction (okay then, a crash) from affecting all current users\&.

.TP
\-1
Like \-S but after one session the server exits\&. This mode is for debugging \fIonly\fR\&.

.TP
\-T
Operate the server in threaded mode\&. The server creates a thread for each connection rather than a fork a process\&. Only available on UNIX systems that offers POSIX threads\&.

.TP
\-s
Use the SR protocol (obsolete)\&.

.TP
\-z
Use the Z39\&.50 protocol (default)\&. This option and \-s complement each other\&. You can use both multiple times on the same command line, between listener\-specifications (see below)\&. This way, you can set up the server to listen for connections in both protocols concurrently, on different local ports\&.

.TP
\-l \fIfile\fR
The logfile\&.

.TP
\-c \fIconfig\fR
A user option that serves as a specifier for some sort of configuration, usually a filename\&. The argument to this option is transferred to member configname of the statserv_options_block\&.

.TP
\-f \fIvconfig\fR
This specifies an XML file that describes one or more YAZ frontend virtual servers\&.

.TP
\-C \fIfname\fR
Sets SSL certificate file name for server (PEM)\&.

.TP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
The log level\&. Use a comma\-separated list of members of the set {fatal,debug,warn,log,malloc,all,none}\&.

.TP
\-u \fIuid\fR
Set user ID\&. Sets the real UID of the server process to that of the given user\&. It's useful if you aren't comfortable with having the server run as root, but you need to start it as such to bind a privileged port\&.

.TP
\-w \fIdir\fR
The server changes to this directory during before listening on incoming connections\&. This option is useful when the server is operating from the inetd daemon (see \-i)\&.

.TP
\-p \fIpidfile\fR
Specifies that the server should write its Process ID to file given by \fIpidfile\fR\&. A typical location would be \fI/var/run/yaz\-ztest\&.pid\fR\&.

.TP
\-i
Use this to make the the server run from the inetd server (UNIX only)\&.

.TP
\-D
Use this to make the server put itself in the background and run as a daemon\&. If neither \-i nor \-D is given, the server starts in the foreground\&.

.TP
\-install
Use this to install the server as an NT service (Windows NT/2000/XP only)\&. Control the server by going to the Services in the Control Panel\&.

.TP
\-installa
Use this to install and activate the server as an NT service (Windows NT/2000/XP only)\&. Control the server by going to the Services in the Control Panel\&.

.TP
\-remove
Use this to remove the server from the NT services (Windows NT/2000/XP only)\&.

.TP
\-t \fIminutes\fR
Idle session timeout, in minutes\&.

.TP
\-k \fIsize\fR
Maximum record size/message size, in kilobytes\&.

.TP
\-r \fIsize\fR
Maximum size of log file before rotation occurs, in kilobytes\&. Default size is 1048576 k (=1 GB)\&.

.TP
\-d \fIdaemon\fR
Set name of daemon to be used in hosts access file\&. See \fBhosts_access\fR(5) and \fBtcpd\fR(8)\&.

.TP
\-m \fItime\-format\fR
Sets the format of time\-stamps in the log\-file\&. Specify a string in the input format to strftime()\&.

.SH "VIRTUAL HOSTS"

.PP
The Virtual hosts mechanism allows a YAZ frontend server to support multiple backends\&. A backend is selected on the basis of the TCP/IP binding (port+listening adddress) and/or the virtual host\&.

.PP
A backend can be configured to execute in a particular working directory\&. Or the YAZ frontend may perform CQL to RPN conversion, thus allowing traditional Z39\&.50 backends to be offered as a SRW/SRU service\&. SRW/SRU Explain information for a particular backend may also be specified\&.

.PP
For the HTTP protocol, the virtual host is specified in the Host header\&. For the Z39\&.50 protocol, the virtual host is specified as in the Initialize Request in the OtherInfo, OID 1\&.2\&.840\&.10003\&.10\&.1000\&.81\&.1\&.

.RS
.Sh "Note"

.PP
Not all Z39\&.50 clients allows the VHOST information to be set\&. For those the selection of the backend must rely on the TCP/IP information alone (port and address)\&.

.RE

.PP
The YAZ frontend server uses XML to describe the backend configurations\&. Command\-line option \-f specifies filename of the XML configuration\&.

.PP
The configuration uses the root element yazgfs\&. This element includes a list of listen elements, followed by one or more server elements\&.

.PP
The listen describes listener (transport end point), such as TCP/IP, Unix file socket or SSL server\&. Content for a listener: 

.TP
CDATA (required)
The CDATA for the listen element holds the listener string, such as tcp:@:210, tcp:server1:2100, etc\&.

.TP
attribute id (optional)
identifier for this listener\&. This may be referred to from server sections\&.
  .RS .Sh "Note" .PP We expect more information to be added for the listen section in a future version, such as CERT file for SSL servers\&. .RE 

.PP
The server describes a server and the parameters for this server type\&. Content for a server: 

.TP
attribute id (optional)
Identifier for this server\&. Currently not used for anything, but it might be for logging purposes\&.

.TP
attribute listenref (optional)
Specifies listener for this server\&. If this attribute is not given, the server is accessible from all listener\&. In order for the server to be used for real, howeever, the virtual host must match (if specified in the configuration)\&.

.TP
element config (optional)
Specifies the server configuration\&. This is equivalent to the config specified using command line option \-c\&.

.TP
element directory (optional)
Specifies a working directory for this backend server\&. If specifid, the YAZ fronend changes current working directory to this directory whenever a backend of this type is started (backend handler bend_start), stopped (backend handler hand_stop) and initialized (bend_init)\&.

.TP
element host (optional)
Specifies the virtual host for this server\&. If this is specified a client \fImust\fR specify this host string in order to use this backend\&.

.TP
element cql2rpn (optional)
Specifies a filename that includes CQL to RPN conversion for this backend server\&. See [xref to refsect1] If given, the backend server will only "see" a Type\-1/RPN query\&.

.TP
element stylesheet (optional)
Specifies the stylesheet reference to be part of SRU HTTP responses when the client does not specify one\&. If neither this is given, nor the client specifies one, no stylesheet reference is part of the SRU HTTP response\&.

.TP
element docpath (optional)
Specifies a path for local file access using HTTP\&. All URLs with a leading prefix (/ exluded) that matches the value of docpath are used for file access\&. For example, if the server is to offer access in directory xsl, the docpath would be xsl and all URLs of the form http://host/exl will result in a local file access\&.

.TP
element explain (optional)
Specifies SRW/SRU ZeeRex content for this server\&. Copied verbatim to the client\&. As things are now, some of the Explain content seeem redundant because host information, etc\&. is also stored elsewhere\&.

.TP
element maximumrecordsize (optional)
Specifies maximum record size/message size, in bytes\&. This value also servers as maximum size of \fIincoming\fR packages (for Record Updates etc)\&. It's the same value as that given by the \-k option\&.
 

.PP
The XML below configures a server that accepts connections from two ports, TCP/IP port 9900 and a local UNIX file socket\&. We name the TCP/IP server public and the other server internal\&.

.IP

  
 <yazgfs>
  <listen id="public">tcp:@:9900</listen>
  <listen id="internal">unix:/var/tmp/socket</listen>
  <server id="server1">
    <host>server1\&.mydomain</host>
    <directory>/var/www/s1</directory>
    <config>config\&.cfg</config>
  </server>
  <server id="server2">
    <host>server2\&.mydomain</host>
    <directory>/var/www/s2</directory>
    <config>config\&.cfg</config>
    <cql2rpn>\&.\&./etc/pqf\&.properties</cql2rpn>
    <explain xmlns="http://explain\&.z3950\&.org/dtd/2\&.0/">
      <serverInfo>
        <host>server2\&.mydomain</host>
        <port>9900</port>
        <database>a</database>
      </serverInfo>
    </explain>
  </server>
  <server id="server3" listenref="internal">
    <directory>/var/www/s3</directory>
    <config>config\&.cfg</config>
  </server>
 </yazgfs>

 
.PP
There are three configured backend servers\&. The first two servers, "server1" and "server2", can be reached by both listener addresses \- since no listenref attribute is specified\&. In order to distinguish between the two a virtual host has been specified for each of server in the host elements\&.

.PP
For "server2" elements for CQL to RPN conversion is supported and explain information has been added (a short one here to keep the example small)\&.

.PP
The third server, "server3" can only be reached via listener "internal"\&.
