    For each service of the protocol, the backend interface declares one or
    two functions. You are required to provide implementations of the
    functions representing the services that you wish to implement.

     This handler is called once for each new connection request, after
     a new process/thread has been created, and an Initialize Request has
     been received from the client. The pointer to the
     <code class="function">bend_init</code> handler is passed in the call to
     <code class="function">statserv_start</code>.
    </p><p>
     This handler is also called when operating in SRU mode - when

     In general, the server frontend expects that the
     <code class="literal">bend_*result</code> pointer that you return is valid at
     least until the next call to a <code class="literal">bend_* function</code>.
     This applies to all of the functions described herein. The parameter
     structure passed to you in the call belongs to the server frontend, and
     you should not make assumptions about its contents after the current
     function call has completed. In other words, if you want to retain any
     of the contents of a request structure, you should copy them.
    </p><p>
     The <code class="literal">errcode</code> should be zero if the initialization of
     the backend went well. Any other value will be interpreted as an error.
     The <code class="literal">errstring</code> isn't used in the current version, but
     one option would be to stick it in the initResponse as a VisibleString.
     The <code class="literal">handle</code> is the most important parameter. It should
     be set to some value that uniquely identifies the current session to
     the backend implementation. It is used by the frontend server in any
     future calls to a backend function.
     The typical use is to set it to point to a dynamically allocated state
     structure that is private to your backend module.
    </p><p>
     The <code class="literal">auth</code> member holds the authentication information
     part of the Z39.50 Initialize Request. Interpret this if your serves
     requires authentication. 
    </p><p>
     The members <code class="literal">peer_name</code>,
     <code class="literal">implementation_id</code>,
     <code class="literal">implementation_name</code> and
     <code class="literal">implementation_version</code> holds
     DNS of client, ID of implementor, name
     of client (Z39.50) implementation - and version.
    </p><p>
     The <code class="literal">bend_</code> - members are set to NULL when
     <code class="function">bend_init</code> is called. Modify the pointers by
     setting them to point to backend functions.

     The <code class="function">bend_search</code> handler is a fairly close
     approximation of a protocol Z39.50 Search Request - and Response PDUs
     The <code class="literal">setname</code> is the resultSetName from the protocol.
     You are required to establish a mapping between the set name and whatever
     your backend database likes to use.
     Similarly, the <code class="literal">replace_set</code> is a boolean value
     corresponding to the resultSetIndicator field in the protocol.
     <code class="literal">num_bases/basenames</code> is a length of/array of character
     pointers to the database names provided by the client.
     The <code class="literal">query</code> is the full query structure as defined in
     the protocol ASN.1 specification.
     It can be either of the possible query types, and it's up to you to
     determine if you can handle the provided query type.
     Rather than reproduce the C interface here, we'll refer you to the
     structure definitions in the file
     <code class="filename">include/yaz/z-core.h</code>. If you want to look at the
     attributeSetId OID of the RPN query, you can either match it against
     your own internal tables, or you can use the
     <code class="literal">oid_getentbyoid</code> function provided by YAZ.
    </p><p>
     The structure contains a number of hits, and an
     <code class="literal">errcode/errstring</code> pair. If an error occurs
     during the search, or if you're unhappy with the request, you should
     set the errcode to a value from the BIB-1 diagnostic set. The value
     will then be returned to the user in a nonsurrogate diagnostic record
     in the response. The <code class="literal">errstring</code>, if provided, will
     go in the addinfo field. Look at the protocol definition for the
     defined error codes, and the suggested uses of the addinfo field.
    </p><p>
     The <code class="function">bend_search</code> handler is also called when
     the frontend server receives a SRU SearchRetrieveRequest.
     For SRU, a CQL query is usually provided by the client.
     The CQL query is available as part of <code class="literal">Z_Query</code>
     structure (note that CQL is now part of Z39.50 via an external).
     To support CQL in existing implementations that only do Type-1,
     we refer to the CQL-to-PQF tool described
     <a href="tools.html#cql.to.pqf" title="1.3.3. CQL to PQF conversion">here</a>.
    </p><p>
     To maintain backwards compatibility, the frontend server
     of yaz always assume that error codes are BIB-1 diagnostics.
     For SRU operation, a Bib-1 diagnostic code is mapped to
     SRU diagnostic.

     The frontend server calls the <code class="function">bend_fetch</code> handler
     when it needs database records to fulfill a Z39.50 Search Request, a
     Z39.50 Present Request or a SRU SearchRetrieveRequest.
     The <code class="literal">setname</code> is simply the name of the result set
     that holds the reference to the desired record.
     The <code class="literal">number</code> is the offset into the set (with 1
     being the first record in the set). The <code class="literal">format</code> field
     is the record format requested by the client (See
     <a href="asn.oid.html" title="3. Object Identifiers">Section 3, &#8220;Object Identifiers&#8221;</a>).
     The value <code class="literal">VAL_NONE</code> indicates that the client did
     not request a specific format. The <code class="literal">stream</code> argument
     is an <span class="acronym">ODR</span> stream which should be used for
     allocating space for structured data records.
     The stream will be reset when all records have been assembled, and
     the response package has been transmitted.
     For unstructured data, the backend is responsible for maintaining a
     static or dynamic buffer for the record between calls.
    </p><p>
     If a SRU SearchRetrieveRequest is received by the frontend server,
     the <code class="literal">referenceId</code> is NULL and the
     <code class="literal">request_format</code> (transfer syntax) is XML (OID name 
     <code class="literal">VAL_TEXT_XML</code>).
     The schema for SRU is stored in both the
     <code class="literal">Z_RecordComposition</code>
     structure and <code class="literal">schema</code> (simple string).
    </p><p>
     In the structure, the <code class="literal">basename</code> is the name of the
     database that holds the
     record. <code class="literal">len</code> is the length of the record returned, in
     bytes, and <code class="literal">record</code> is a pointer to the record.
     <code class="literal">last_in_set</code> should be nonzero only if the record
     returned is the last one in the given result set.
     <code class="literal">errcode</code> and <code class="literal">errstring</code>, if
     given, will be interpreted as a global error pertaining to the
     set, and will be returned in a non-surrogate-diagnostic.
     If you wish to return the error as a surrogate-diagnostic
     (local error) you can do this by setting
     <code class="literal">surrogate_flag</code> to 1 also.
    </p><p>
     If the <code class="literal">len</code> field has the value -1, then
     <code class="literal">record</code> is assumed to point to a constructed data
     type. The <code class="literal">format</code> field will be used to determine
     which encoder should be used to serialize the data.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
      If your backend generates structured records, it should use
      <code class="function">odr_malloc()</code> on the provided stream for allocating
      data: This allows the frontend server to keep track of the record sizes.
     </p></div><p>
     The <code class="literal">format</code> field is mapped to an object identifier
