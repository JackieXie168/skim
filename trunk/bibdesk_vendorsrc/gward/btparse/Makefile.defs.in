# If you plan to install btparse on your system, you might want to change
# the installation directories.  Note that these can also be overridden
# when you run `configure'; see the INSTALL file for details.  Other than
# that, though, everything in this file is set automatically when you run
# the `configure' script -- so nothing else should need changing.
