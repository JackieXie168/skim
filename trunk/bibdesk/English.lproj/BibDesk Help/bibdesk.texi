@node Quick Start
@chapter Quick Start 
@abstract{Quick start to BibDesk.}

Using BibDesk should be pretty natural for the average user of
BibTeX. Simply open your .bib file with BibDesk and start working. @xref{Managing References}
To get you up to speed faster, here are a few important features and
differences from other BibTeX editors.

@heading Accented Characters

@cindex accented characters
If you are used to writing LaTeX code for accented characters and
special fonts, you will be glad to know that BibDesk handles most of
that for you now. See @ref{Editing References}
for an overview, or @ref{Character Conversion} for more detail.

@heading Capitalized Letters in Fields

@cindex capitalization
If you use braces in your BibTeX fields to protect meaningful
capitalization, BibDesk attempts not to interfere. The braces will be
saved and any previews will show the intended capitalization.

Searches will match the string without the braces - a search for
"LaTeX" will match a publication with the title "@verb{.{L}a{T}e{X}.}".

@heading File Encodings

@cindex encodings
If you have a BibTeX file that is not stored with ASCII encoding,
BibDesk will work with the file's encoding. See @ref{encoding-notes}
and @ref{Character Encodings} for further information.

@heading Citation Keys

BibDesk can help you maintain useful and readable citation keys
painlessly. See @ref{Cite Key Preferences} for more information.

@heading Macro Support

@cindex macro
BibDesk supports BibTeX macros. See @ref{Editing Fields with Macros} and
@ref{Editing a Document's Macro Definitions} for more information on how to edit
them.

@heading Crossref Support

@cindex crossref support
BibDesk searches and sorts entries that utilize the BibTeX @samp{crossref} field,
and allows creating @samp{crossref} entries easily.  See @ref{Creating and Editing Crossrefs}
for information on adding @samp{crossref} links, and @ref{Crossref Preferences} for
configuring @samp{crossref} options.

@c ======================================================================================

@node BibTeX Intro
@chapter BibTeX Intro
@abstract{Introduction to BibTeX.}

@cindex BibTeX

BibTeX database files are in a text format with a few conventions you
will want to know. See @ref{Formatting Names} and
 @ref{Publication Types}) for answers to common questions.

It helps to know what the parts of a BibTeX file are. Here's a trivial
example to help illustrate. First we have a @emph{macro definition}:

@example
@@string@{PACT = "International Conference on Processors, Architectures and Compilation Techniques"@}
@end example

Next a single entry:
@example
@@proceedings@{pact02,
	    booktitle = PACT,
	    Year = 2002,
	    Month = sep,
	    Address = "Harvard Square"@}
@end example

The terminology we'll use to describe the entry is as follows:

@example
@@publication-type@{citation-key, field-name = value@}
@end example

Any value can be either a quoted string (using either @samp{""} or @samp{@{@}}) or a
number, or a macro (like @samp{PACT} in the above example).

@anchor{Publication Types}
@heading Publication Types

Each publication is assigned a type, which along with carrying some
information about the publication, determines how it will be formatted
later in conjunction with BibTeX styles.

@heading Citation Keys

A cite key is a unique identifier for a given reference.  BibTeX scans your document for
occurrences of a cite command with a cite key embedded in it, and translates it into a
properly formatted reference.  Several patterns are common
in choosing cite keys, from simple ones such as ``lastnameYEAR'' to more complicated
abbreviations of journal names and author names.  BibDesk will automatically
generate cite keys for you (@xref{Citation Keys}), or you can enter your own in the editor.
BibDesk takes a fairly strict interpretation of the valid characters for cite keys,
and the characters "@code{ "@@',\#@}@{~%}" (including the space character) are never allowed,
while you will be warned if you use one of "@code{&$^}" in a cite key.  Cite keys are
essentially TeX commands, so you should avoid using underscores, for instance, if you
ever need to print the actual cite key itself.

@heading Field Data

BibTeX defines numerous required and optional fields for each type, such as "Title" or "Author".  
BibDesk's editor will highlight the required fields in red, and optional fields are black.
Any field may be used with any type, however, and you can add your own fields to entries
and use them with custom bibliography styles.  For instance, you can add a "Keywords" field
to all of your entries, then modify a bibliography style to print out the list of keywords
in your bibliography.

Field entries are subject to limitations of TeX itself, and if you copy-and-paste a title 
with characters that are special to TeX, such as @samp{$}, errors will occur when
processing your file with BibTeX and TeX.  Other than that, any text is valid for a
BibTeX field, and is not limited to bibliographic information (some people store
addresses in a BibTeX database).

@anchor{Formatting Names}
@heading Formatting Names

Author and editor lists in BibTeX files are written as a single string
using the word "and" as a separator between names, like this example:

@example
"Adam Maxwell and Michael O. McCracken"
@end example

If a name has two parts, commas are used to determine which parts are
the first, middle and last names. For example, the following two names
are the same:

@example
"Adam Maxwell" "Maxwell, Adam"
@end example

BibTeX also handles more complicated names. Prefixes to given names
such as @samp{van} or @samp{van den} and suffixes such as @samp{Jr.} or @samp{III} are
OK:

@example
"van den Huevel, Jr., Johan A"
@end example

@heading BibTeX Macros

@cindex macro

Macros are a time saving feature that save typing when you have to
repeat the same long journal name over and over. If you define a
macro, you can just type the short version and BibTeX will substitute
the full version in processing.

Macro definitions look like this:
@example
@@string@{PACT = "International Conference on Processors, Architectures and Compilation Techniques"@}
@end example

To use the macro, just use the first part of the definition without quotes (here @code{PACT}) 
as the value for a field in the BibTeX file, as in the example above.

Note that in our example, we also used a macro @samp{sep}, which was not
defined in the example. Common three-letter month names are usually
defined appropriately in your @ref{Style Files} for the document's
language, and may also be abbreviated depending on the citation style.


BibDesk supports reading, editing and saving BibTeX macros. See
@ref{Editing Fields with Macros} for further information.

@heading BibTeX Crossrefs
@cindex crossref

Crossrefs are another time saving feature, and allow changes in a single
entry (here termed the "parent") to propagate to the entries which link to it 
(here termed the "children").

For example, this entry defines a single volume in a series of books, but is
missing some key information, such as Title and Author!  This is supplied by
the item whose cite key matches the @samp{Crossref} field's value.

@example 
@@book@{book-crossref,
	Crossref = @{whole-set@},
	Edition = @{Second@},
	Note = @{This is a cross-referencing BOOK entry@},
	Series = @{The Art of Computer Programming@},
	Title = @{Seminumerical Algorithms@},
	Volume = 2,
	Year = @{@{\noopsort@{1973c@}@}1981@}@}
@end example

Continuing our example, this parent entry contains the information common to
all of the books in the series:

@example
@@book@{whole-set,
	Author = @{Knuth, Donald E.@},
	Note = @{Seven volumes planned (this is a cross-referenced set of BOOKs)@},
	Publisher = @{Addison-Wesley@},
	Series = @{Four volumes@},
	Title = @{The Art of Computer Programming@},
	Year = @{@{\noopsort@{1973a@}@}@{\switchargs@{--90@}@{1968@}@}@}@}
@end example

One important caveat when working with crossreferences in BibTeX is that all parent
items must follow their children in the file.  BibDesk can sort the items for you
with @menutitle{Sort Publications for Crossrefs} in the Publication menu, or you can
allow BibDesk to automatically sort the items when saving (@xref{Crossref Preferences}).

@anchor{Style Files}
@heading Style Files

BibTeX uses style files (extension @code{.bst}) to produce formatted bibliographies
for various publishers.  You probably have numerous BibTeX styles installed on your
computer, and many more can be found on @uref{http://ctan.tug.org/, CTAN}, the
Comprehensive TeX Archive Network.

Writing your own BibTeX style files is possible, but not recommended for the
faint of heart (or even the not-so-faint of heart).  Patrick W. Daly's
@uref{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/custom-bib/, custom-bib}
package is a valuable asset when you need a customized bibliography style, as it
walks you through a semi-automatic creation process.

@heading BibTeX References

The canonical reference for BibTeX itself is Oren Patashnik's
@uref{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/doc/btxdoc.pdf, BibTeXing},
which you may have already as @uref{/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/doc/bibtex/base/btxdoc.dvi, btxdoc.dvi} 
in your TeX tree. Standard references such as @samp{The LaTeX Companion} are very
helpful in understanding and debugging BibTeX, and searching the
@uref{http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html, TeX FAQ} is usually a
good idea as well.

box.

@subheading Opening a File Using a Command-Line Filter

This feature lets you specify any command line that produces a BibTeX
file and open it in BibDesk directly. If you have command line
conversion tools from other formats, this is a handy way to use them.
For instance, suppose you have a file called @samp{searchresults.isi} in the ISI file format from
an online database.  Using the @uref{http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/software/bibutils/bibutils.html, BibUtils}
suite of command line utilities (available here), you can translate that file into BibTeX with the following
command: @code{/usr/local/bin/isi2xml | /usr/local/bin/xml2bib}, with the paths adjusted appropriately for your
installation.  

@image{gfx/filterCmd}

The drop-down menu will save the last seven commands used, which should be sufficient for most needs!
Note that BibDesk can open RIS files directly, so a filter isn't required for them.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Opening an RIS File
@section Opening an RIS File
@abstract{Opening an RIS file.}

@cindex PubMed
@cindex RIS
@cindex service

BibDesk expects a file with the extension @samp{.fcgi} or @samp{.ris}.
Many of the RIS tags are converted into their BibTeX equivalents, but unknown tags are left as-is for you to deal with manually.
BibDesk's RIS import feature converts some HTML characters and tags into LaTeX commands, which can be handy when importing large
numbers of references; the LaTeX produced may be rather primitive, however.

@subheading PubMed

Just do your search as usual on
PubMed, and then select the settings as in the following image:

@image{gfx/pubmed}

The important settings are that it should be set to Display
@buttontitle{MEDLINE} and Send to @buttontitle{File}. Then click the
@buttontitle{Send to} button, and a file will
be saved to your download folder. You can then use BibDesk to open
this file. Once you have opened the file it cannot be saved back in
the same format. If you want to, you can save it as a BibTeX file, or
transfer the translated entries over into a BibTeX file that you use
permanently.

@subheading Other Online Databases

Many online databases have the capability to export RIS 
(the @uref{http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp, Reference Manager format}), 
and BibDesk can open those files directly.
@uref{http://www.sonnysoftware.com/, SonnySoftware} offers a free application
called ``ReferenceMiner'' which searches PubMed, the Library of Congress, and
Amazon.  References can be dragged from ReferenceMiner directly into BibDesk's
publication list, which may be more convenient for those sources.

@subheading Using RIS Services

The Services menu items @menutitle{BibDesk > Add to Bibliography} and 
@menutitle{BibDesk > New Document With RIS}can be used from a text editor or 
web browser which supports Services to either add selected RIS text to an 
existing document, or create a new document based on the selected text.  
Further, RIS can be pasted or dragged directly into BibDesk's publication 
list as text, so at least one method should be convenient for your particular situation! 
BibDesk can also save RIS files directly, although some modification of 
the original source will occur, and this is only recommended
when it is necessary to share files with other people or applications.

@node Importing From Other Programs
@section Importing From Other Programs
@abstract{Importing bibliographies from programs such as EndNote and Bookends.}

@cindex importing
@cindex EndNote
@cindex Bookends

Some reference managers export bibliographies to BibTeX, but they do not add
cite keys to the references.  Unfortunately, BibDesk will fail to open such
files, and will display an error message when you attempt to open them.

To work around this problem, you can use BibDesk's
@menutitle{Open BibTeX Using Temporary Cite Keys@dots{}} menu item, found under
the @menutitle{File} menu.  This uses a regular expression to replace empty cite keys 
with a temporary key in a new BibTeX document. 
Make sure the file has a .bib file extension. 

After opening the file, the items for which a temporary cite key was generated 
are automatically selected. 
At present the key @samp{FixMe} is used, in case you need to search for it manually. 
Proper cite keys for these items should then be generated using 
@menutitle{Generate Cite Key} from the @menutitle{Publication} menu. 
You will be offered the choice to do perform this action immediately.

@node Quick Search
@section Quick Search

@cindex searching
@kindex Cmd-F

The quick search field lets you enter sub-strings that might be in
author names, titles or dates, and the reference view will display
only matching publications. There are several built-in options. For
example, "All Fields" (search every entry except the pub type at once),
Keywords (search the keywords entries) and BibTeX Type (search by 
publication type).

@image{gfx/quickSearchField}

The quick search field is configurable by selecting @menutitle{Add Field@dots{}},
which allows you to add any string you want to the menu. If a
publication has that field, it will be searched. Adding the field
"Cite Key" (with that exact capitalization) will allow you to search
the citation key of publications. ("All Fields" also searches the
citation key.)

@node Advanced Search Options
@section Advanced Search Options

@cindex boolean search
@cindex accents in search
@cindex braces in search

BibDesk's quick search field also supports a Boolean search, using
@samp{+} for @samp{and} or @samp{|} for @samp{or} operators (no quotes), as
Apple's Help Viewer does in Mac OS X 10.4 and greater.
When both are used, @samp{+} has a higer priority than @samp{|}.
For example searching for @samp{hydrology | clay + water} will return
matches containing either @samp{hydrology,} or both @samp{clay} and @samp{water.}
Custom grouping, overriding this priority, is not supported at this time.

If you do not explicitly search for accented characters, the
search feature will return results with accented characters, so it is
slightly fuzzy; further, case is ignored unless you explicitly enter
uppercase letters.  Sound confusing?  
For example, searching for @samp{Burger,} could return matches containing
@samp{R. B@ue{}rger} and @samp{J. Burger,} but not @samp{Hamburger.}  Searching for
@samp{B@ue{}rger} will only return items that match the case and accent exactly,
such as @samp{R. B@ue{}rger.}

As mentioned elsewhere, braces are ignored when searching, so searching
for @samp{BibDesk} will find @samp{@{B@}ib@{D@}esk} as well as @samp{BibDesk.}  Of course,
this will not find @samp{bibdesk}, since uppercase letters were used in this
example.

@node Find and Replace
@section Find and Replace

@cindex searching
@cindex regular expression
@cindex find and replace
@kindex Shift-Cmd-F

BibDesk supports Find and Replace operations on bibliographies, either on the entire
file or selected items.  Use the @menutitle{Database Find and Replace@dots{}} item of the 
@menutitle{Edit} menu (key shortcut @shiftcmd{F}) to show the find panel.

@image{gfx/findAndReplace}

In this panel, you can enter the name of a field to search (such as Author or Title),
and choose whether the search is case-sensitive and whether it searches only the
current selection or all items in the current groups.  The @buttontitle{Find Next} button 
will highlight eachmatching reference in turn, and the @buttontitle{Replace & Find} button 
will replace the text in the currently selected entry and highlight the next match.
The @buttontitle{Replace All} button will replace all entries matching the search, either
in the current selection or in all the displayed items (depending on the check box).

Note that this feature is complementary to the @ref{Quick Search} feature, and does
not replace it.  For instance, the Find and Replace panel will not match cross-referenced
(inherited) fields, and does not strip accents or braces.  Further, searching by
"All Fields" is not possible at this time, since it doesn't make sense in the context of
the Find and Replace operation.

@heading Batch-Adding a Field

This panel also allows you to set the value of a field for all (selected) items at once.
The field will be added if necessary.  Check the "Overwrite or Add this field" button 
to the right of the field name, and enter the value to set in the "Replace with" field.
Then hit the @buttontitle{Replace All} button to set this field in all the currently 
selected or displayed items (depending on your settings).

@heading Regular Expressions

The Find and Replace panel also supports Perl-compatible regular expressions, via the PCRE
library (see @uref{http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt} for the manual pages).  If you are
unfamiliar with regular expressions, they are a very powerful tool for matching patterns
in text.  Numerous resources are available on the internet for learning regular expressions, 
such as this one: @uref{http://www.anybrowser.org/bbedit/grep.shtml}.

@heading Macro Find and Replace

Searching for BibTeX macros is also supported via the @samp{This is a Macro} checkbox next to
the Find and Replace text boxes.  For instance, if you have defined 
@samp{@@string@{jhe = "Journal of Hydraulic Engineering"@}} in your file, but decide to
replace "jhe" with "j-hydeng", you could search the "Journal" field for "jhe"
as a macro, and replace it with "j-hydeng" as a macro.

@subheading Examples

Here is a slightly more advanced example.  Suppose all of your BibTeX entries have a "Year" field
such as @samp{Year = @{1995@}}, but you want to replace these with @samp{Year = 1995}
(note the braces are removed in the second one).  To do this in BibDesk's editor, you
would open each entry, select the "Year" field, edit as raw BibTeX, and remove the
surrounding braces.  Using the Find panel, you could do the following, using the regular
expression search option:

@example
Find String:  @samp{([0-9]+)}  (uncheck "This is a Macro")
Replace With:  @samp{$0}  (check "This is a Macro")
@end example

This will set all of your "Year" fields containing one or more digits 0-9 to a number.
Since the $0 backreference matches the entire pattern captured in the "Find" operation,
you are just reinserting the previous value as a macro value.
 
Another useful example is searching for "Journal of Geophysical Research" as a 
non-macro, and replace it with "jgr" as a macro, now that BibDesk has full macro support
(@xref{BibTeX Intro} for more information on BibTeX macros).  Regular expressions
would not be necessary for this operation.

@node Searching File Contents
@section Searching File Contents

@cindex searching
@cindex file search
@cindex SearchKit
@cindex Spotlight

If you use Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and later, BibDesk allows you to search the local files
associated with your bibliography.  To use this feature, select the @samp{File Content}
item from the toolbar search field menu, and enter a term you want to find.

This feature is similar to Apple's Spotlight search, but limits the search scope to files
that are associated with a particular BibTeX database.  Rankings of the relative goodness
of each search result are shown, together with the title of the associated BibTeX entry.

Double-clicking a row in the search result window will open the associated file.  When you
clear the search text, BibDesk will automatically select the associated BibTeX item or
items in your database.

While the initial search will be somewhat slow as files are indexed, subsequent searches
will be very fast (although the index will be rebuilt when you close and reopen the document).
For information on supported search query features (wildcards, Boolean operators), see the
@uref{http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Reference/SearchKit/index.html, SearchKit Reference}.

@node Searching With Spotlight
@section Searching With Spotlight
@cindex searching

Under Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and later, bibliography files can even be searched when BibDesk 
is not running because the program supports Apple's Spotlight search facility. 
A Spotlight searchable index is automatically created whenever a file is 
saved within Bibdesk, and the index is updated with every save.
The index is located in @samp{~/Library/Caches/Metadata/edu.ucsd.cs.mmccrack.bibdesk}
at present, but the contents of this directory must not be relied on as the file
format may change in future.  If the index files are deleted, they will be recreated
the next time each file is saved.

Additionally, BibDesk's Spotlight search plugin adds the text of BibTeX and RIS files
to the Spotlight index, but this does not allow you to identify a particular record in the files.

@item Select formatted text and choose @menutitle{Add to Bibliography} from @ref{Services, System Services}.
@item Open other file and @ref{Drag and Drop} or @ref{Copy and Paste} between database windows.
@item Choose @ref{Importing From Other Programs, @menutitle{Open Using Temporary Cite Keys}} to fix bibtex with missing cite keys.
@item Choose @ref{Opening a File, @menutitle{Open Using Filter}} to preprocess data.
@end itemize

Here @samp{formatted text} means bibliography data in any of a number of formats that BibDesk can recognize.
This includes BibTeX, RIS, Medline (PubMed), MARC, JSTOR, and ISI Web of Science.

@node Drag and Drop
@subsection Drag and Drop

@cindex drag and drop
@cindex add to bibliography

References can also be added to a bibliography by dragging entries
from a text source (text editor, web browser) into BibDesk's main publicationslist.
The text can be BibTeX, RIS (Reference Manager), MARC, JSTOR or ISI Web Of Science formatted text.
Here's a fancy picture:

@image{gfx/dragIntoBib}

You can also drag a file containing formatted text in any of these formats and drop them into BibDesk's
main publications list. 

You can easily add a new bibliography item that links to a file, such as a PDF file.
Just drag the file from a Finder window (or anywhere else) and drop it into BibDesk's
main publications list. Similarly, you can add a new bibliography item linking to a remote URL
by dropping a @samp{webloc} file on the main publications list. 

References can be dragged from the main publications list (or another source)
and dropped on an editor window, as well, which will
only set non-empty fields of the publication; this can be quite useful when you are 
entering a number of items from a common source.  If you do want to overwrite all fields
when dragging to an editor, simply hold down the option key while you drag.

Moreover, references can be dragged from one publication list and dropped on another,
to easily copy items between documents. 

@node Copy and Paste
@subsection Copy and Paste

@cindex copy and paste
@cindex add to bibliography

References can be added to a publications list by copying them from another
source and pasting them into BibDesk's main window.  The text being pasted must
be BibTeX, RIS (Reference Manager), MARC, JSTOR or ISI Web Of Science formatted text, or an error will occur.

Furthermore, everything that can be @ref{Drag and Drop, dragged and dropped} on a BibDesk window can also
be added using Copy and Paste. 

@node Services
@subsection Services

@cindex service
@cindex add to bibliography

BibDesk also supports Mac OS X Services to add references to an existing bibliography.
Services are found under the application menu next to the Apple menu, and operate
on selected text.  

To use this feature, select BibTeX or RIS text in an application
that supports Services (such as OmniWeb), and choose the @menutitle{Add to Bibliography}
menu item of BibDesk's @menutitle{Services} submenu.
The selected text will be added to the frontmost document in BibDesk automatically.

@image{gfx/textImport}

If you have a source of references that isn't in a structured form,
you can use the @menutitle{Add New Publications from Clipboard} menu item in the
@menutitle{Publication} menu (or the key shortcut @optcmd{L}) to open a
sheet that lets you add references by selecting text and assigning
that text to fields in a new reference. You can also choose the 
@menutitle{Add New Publications from File} menu item (key shortcut @shiftcmd{L}) 
to add references from an arbitrary text file, or the 
@menutitle{Add New Publications from Web} menu item (key shortcut @cmd{L}), 
to add publactions from a website. 

If the clipboard or the file contains formatted text that BibDesk can understand, 
such as BibTeX, RIS, Medline (PubMed), MARC, JSTOR, and ISI Web of Science formatted text, 
Bibdesk will parse the text and the new references are immediately added to the database 
instead of openingthe sheet to do it by hand. 

Examples of reference sources that this would be convenient for are
emails, conference proceedings web sites, and the text from a list of
citations at the end of a publication.

When the sheet opens, it loads the data on the clipboard into the
left-hand side of the sheet. If the last thing you've copied was text,
it will show that text. If the text is a URL, it will instead load
that URL and display the web page. If you know you want to use a web
page that is not on the clipboard, you can use the @menutitle{Add New
Publication from Web} menu item instead.

The @buttontitle{Open} button gives you the option to choose other sources of
information. If the sheet is displaying a website, there are navigation
controls, including back, forward, and a button for reload and stop.

Using the contextual menu on the web page, you can bookmark pages to
come back to at a later time, or save the URL of a link or the page
itself as the URL or Local-Url fields for the current publication.

The right hand side is a table representation of a publication. You
can choose its type and it will load the appropriate field names to
edit. As you add data, it will update the citation key with the
current suggested citation key according to the format set in the 
@ref{Cite Key Preferences} Preferences.
When you are done editing, choose @buttontitle{Add} to add the current
item to the document, then @buttontitle{Close} when you are done adding.

The sheet is designed to make this common task more efficient. Select
the text from the source on the left, and you can drag or copy and
paste into the table on the right to fill in the publication's
information. Edit and make any other changes you want by
double-clicking on the rightmost column of the table.

@kindex Cmd-0 - Cmd-9
@kindex Cmd-=

You can make adding data faster by double-clicking the name of
the field you want the selected text to fill and it will be added for
you. You can also use the key shortcuts @cmd{&#0048} through @cmd{9} or 
@optcmd{&#0048} through @optcmd{9} to copy the selected text over to the 
corresponding field. If you hold down the Control key at the same time, 
the selected text will be appended to the field value. 
Alternatively, you can type @cmd{=} to temporarily 
move to the table to select a field to fill. After that, start typing 
the field name or use the arrow keys to find the field and hit the 
Enter key to fill it and return to what you were doing. Use the 
Tab or Escape key to just go back without filling the field. 

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Editing References
@section Editing References
@abstract{Editing the data in your references.}

@kindex Cmd-I

Once references have been added to the bibliography, they can be
edited by selecting a reference and choosing @menutitle{Get Info} from the
@menutitle{File} menu, typing @cmd{I}, or double-clicking the reference.

This opens the Editor window, which looks something
like this:

@image{gfx/editWindow}

You can then fill in the appropriate fields for your reference. The
type pop-up menu lets you choose from the canonical BibTeX publication
types (e.g., article, book, phdthesis). Field titles highlighted in
red represent required fields for the chosen reference type (article
in the case of the above screenshot). 

Fields can be added with the @menutitle{+} button in the status bar. 
You can also add or remove field using the appropriate menu item in the 
action pop-up menu in the status bar (the button with the little gear icon.) 
You can also change the name of any custom field using the action menu. 
This can also be done by double-clicking the field name. 
Note that this is not allowed for standard fields.  
Also, BibDesk verifies that cite keys are unique before committing 
a reference to the bibliography.

When editing, you can use a key sequence (@opt{}-esc) to pop up a list
of similar items in your bibliography for autocompletion, just as you
can elsewhere in Mac OS X.  On some laptop keyboard layouts you may need to use
fn-F5, or if you have changed your key bindings, make sure the @code{complete:}
command is bound.

When editing, changing pub type never loses information. In
other words, if you put a booktitle in when it was inproceedings, and
you change it to phdthesis, it will still have that booktitle.

@subheading Viewing a linked file

You can view a linked file in its appropriate application by clicking
on the @buttontitle{View File} button, which has the file's icon as its
image. If no file is linked, the button displays a question mark.

In either case, you can click and hold on the button or click the 
little arrow to get a menuwhich gives you options to choose a file to link. 
Another way of setting the Local-Url link is by dragging a file onto 
the @buttontitle{View File} button or the Local-Url text field.

If you enter a local file field by hand, it is important to know that 
it accepts either a full file URL, or an absolute or relative file path. 
Note that for URLs special characters like spaces should be escaped 
(the escape for a space character is %20). Relative paths are interpreted 
relative to the containing .bib documents folder. 

If your your linked file is a PDF, you can use the @buttontitle{View in Drawer}
button to view it without leaving BibDesk. Pressing and holding that
button gives you the option of viewing it as a PDF or viewing just
the text of the PDF, so you can select the text to copy and paste
into the data fields.

You can also view the web page specified in the ``URL'' field using
the @buttontitle{View in Drawer} button to view it in the drawer in BibDesk or
by clicking the @buttontitle{View Remote} button to open it in your preferred
web browser.

If you like to keep the URL set to the download location of the
paper, clicking and holding the @buttontitle{View Remote} button will show a
menu that lets you choose from the URLs of recently downloaded files
in Safari.

You can also set the URL field by dragging a web location file on the 
@buttontitle{View Remote} button or the Url text field. 
 
The @buttontitle{Annote} and @buttontitle{Abstract} tabs provide access to larger text areas
for these types of information. Rss-Description is covered in
@ref{Default Fields Preferences}.

Below the table view is the Notes pane, which shows the contents of
the highlighted reference. It can also be set (in the 
@ref{General Preferences} Preferences) to show the entire selected entry as nicely formatted
text.

@image{gfx/rawEdit}

You can edit a field as raw BibTeX by pressing @cmd{R} in the edit
window when one of the form fields has the keyboard focus.

See the @ref{BibTeX Intro} for more details on BibTeX with macros.

When a field is edited as raw BibTeX, an extra view is shown below the field. 
This shows the expanded value of the BibTeX string, or reports errors if the BibTeX 
string you entered is not valid BibTeX. 
Note that bare strings in raw BibTeX mode are surrounded by curly braces 
(`@{' and `@}') or double-quotes (`"'). 

The next time you try to edit a field that contains raw BibTeX, 
the field will automatically go into raw BibteX mode.
Text fields with raw BibTeX (e.g. a number or macro) is shown as dark blue
in the editor, to provide a quick visual reference.

You can use autocompletion in macro editing as well, so you don't have to remember 
all of your cryptic abbreviations or constantly refer to the macro editor.  Edit as raw BibTeX as 
described above, and start typing the expanded value; for a ``Journal'' field, this would 
be the actual name of the journal.  Hit @opt{}-esc, and a 
list of possible entries should appear (based on the @@string definitions in your file), and 
you can then insert the correct value from the list.

See the @ref{BibTeX Intro} for more information of macros in BibTeX, and 
@ref{Editing Fields with Macros} on how to use macros in references. 

@image{gfx/macrosWindow}

Macro definitions consist of a pair of a macro key, which is used in 
the raw BibTeX string, and a definition string. The definition can in fact 
be a raw BibTeX string, containing macros itself. 

You can add a macro definition by pressing the @buttontitle{+} button. 
Pressing the @buttontitle{-} button removes the selected macro defintions. 
You can edit the key and the definition value by double clicking the 
corresponding cell in the table, or by pressing the return key when an item
is selected. See @ref{Editing Fields with Macros} about how to edit the definition
value as a raw BibTeX string. 

For quick searches through the list without using the mouse, you can type a
few characters of any word in the definition string you are looking for,
and that item will be selected for you.  This is helpful for looking up macro
keys when adding references.

You can create a crossreferenced item using the BibTeX @samp{Crossref} field in
various ways.  To manually add a crossreference to an existing entry, add the
@samp{Crossref} field to the entry in the editor, then enter the cite key of the parent item.  
As an alternative, you can hold down the command and option keys and drag the 
parent item from the main publication list into the editor window of the child item.

To create a new crossreferenced item based on an existing item, you can also select the
parent item in the publication list and use @menutitle{New Publication With Crossref} 
(keyboard shortcut @optcmd{N}) from the @menutitle{Publication} menu or contextual menu. 
Alternatively, you can press the @buttontitle{New Publication} toolbar button while 
holding the Option key down.

Crossreferenced fields which are inherited from the parent publication are shown as
gray text in the editor, or light blue if they are macro values.  Inherited fields can
also be recognized by the gray arrow button in the editor field, which will open the parent
item for editing.

the selected items will be removed from any currently selected smart group, 
they will not be deleted from the database. You can force them to be deleted from the 
database by holding the @buttontitle{Option} key down while choosing @menutitle{Delete}. 

Either way, a warning will appear to verify that you want to
delete the reference, unless you have disabled this warning. 
You can enable the warning in the @ref{General Preferences,General Preferences} pane. 
Delete operations are always undoable. 

Note that when the group table is selected, choosing the @menutitle{Delete} menu item or 
pressing the @buttontitle{Delete} button will remove any selected smart groups. 

The @menutitle{Cut} menu item, with keyboard shortcut @cmd{X}, copies the selected publications before deleting them. 
As for the @menutitle{Delete} menu item, this will remove items from selected smart groups

You can control the order of the columns by moving them directly.

To add a field that isn't displayed, use the column management
menu. There are three ways to access this menu; In the menu bar under
@menutitle{View > Columns}, by Control-clicking on a column name, or by
clicking the small button at the top right of the table.

It has a menu of fields you can add, or you can choose to add any
field that isn't listed by typing in the box. You can add a column for
any field you like, even if that field doesn't exist in any of the
publications listed.

You can also easily remove a column, by unchecking the columns name in 
one of the menus mentioned above. 

The Columns usually simply display the content of the relevant field.
There are a few special columns, where information is displayed that 
is more informative to the user. Below we discuss some of these special fields. 

@subheading Title 
@cindex Title

Normally, the Title column will display the content of a Title field, if it exists. 
For inbook type items, the Title refers to the title of the whole work. 
Therefore the Chapter field is added to the title displayed in the Title column. 
If this is empty, the Pages field is used, if available. 

@subheading Authors and Editors 
@cindex Authors and Editors

You have the option of showing Authors together or separately.  If you simply
select 'Author' you will get all the authors connected by 'and', if you choose 
First Author, well, you just get the First Author.

References can have both Authors and Editors.  Most of the time the Authors are of primary
interest, but some books don't have Authors, just Editors.  If you select one of the Author
options (eg First Author) and there is only an Editor, then the field will be blank.
To avoid this choose the equivalent Author or Editor column (eg First Author or Editor),
and the Editors will only be shown if there are no Authors.

In some academic fields the last author is the head of the lab, and users find it convenient
to sort their papers by the last author.  This can be done by adding the Last Author [or Editor] field.

@subheading Container 
@cindex Container

The special column 'Container' can be added to the table.  It is useful for
types that are part of a larger document and displays the title of that
'Container' document.  It will display a slightly different field depending
on the type of the item.

@multitable @columnfractions .5 .5
@headitem Type @tab Container Field
@item article @tab Journal
@item incollection @tab Booktitle
@item inproceedings @tab Booktitle
@item conference @tab Booktitle

If you use a special type that has a container concept write to bibdesk-develop@@lists.sourceforge.net
and it can be added. 

@subheading Local-Url
@cindex Local-Url
@cindex drag and drop, files

The Local-Url column is the column with the column with a little icon depicting a file in the header. 

The Local-Url column displays a little icon for a file that is linked through 
the Local-Url field, of course only if the Local-Url field is set. 
If the Local-Url field for an item is set, but the file could not be found 
on the system, the cell in the Local-Url column displays a file icon with a question mark. 
This way you can easily track missing linked files. 

When a cell in the Local-Url column is double-clicked, the linked file will be opened 
using the default application for the corresponding file type. 
The icon can also be dragged from the table to the Finder in order to copy it to another location, 
or it can be dragged into a specific application in the Dock to open the file in a specific application 
or perhaps mail it as an attachment.

@cindex Url
@cindex drag and drop, URLs
@subheading Url

The Url column is the column with the column with an @@-sign in the header. 

Similarly, the Url column displays a little webloc icon (a file icon with an @@-sign) 
when the Url field of the item is set. 

Double-clicking a cell in the Url column will open the linked remote URL 
in your default browser application.   

@subheading Date
@cindex Date

The Date column displays the date of the item, which is constructed from the Year and Month 
fields of the item. However if a Date field is set, that is used instead. 

@subheading Item Number 
@cindex Item Number

The Item Number column shows a little #-mark in the header. The column displays the 
order of the item as it appears in the file. 

@subheading BibTeX Type
@cindex BibTeX Type

The BibTeX Type column displays the publication type of the item. 
Be aware that Type is a different BibTeX field, unrelated to the BibTeX Type.

The preview panel shows you the currently selected references as a
formatted bibliography. The bibliography's format is based on the
current style file (set in the preference pane 
@ref{Preview Preferences}). This helps in spotting errors and omissions in your
references, as LaTeX and BibTeX are actually used to generate the PDF preview. 
The front matter and macros from the current bibliography document are
used for previewing.

@image{gfx/typesetPreview}

@image{gfx/typesetPreview-rtf}

The preview is available as PDF (generated by LaTeX), or as Text (actually RTF/Rich Text Format),
generated by LaTeX2RTF.  Since LaTeX2RTF only interprets a subset of LaTeX and BibTeX
commands and styles, results may vary for the Text preview, but its intent is to
provide a formatted reference list suitable for pasting directly into TextEdit or
similar programs.

An odd-sized page layout is used so that you don't have to scroll in order to see
the text, which allows you to have a smaller preview window.  However, this is not
desirable for printed output, so you may wish to edit the LaTeX template file
(see the @ref{Preview Preferences} preference pane for more details).

@subheading Selecting Duplicates

To identify duplicate references in your database, use the @menutitle{Select Duplicates} item
of the @menutitle{Publication} menu.  BibDesk compares all standard fields of each item and
selects possible duplicates and the ``original'' item.  
Cite-key and type are compared case-insensitively, while other
fields are compared case-sensitively without removing any @TeX{}-specific commands.

For a less rigorous comparison, choose @menutitle{Select Possible Duplicates} from the @menutitle{Publication} menu.  
With this option, similar to the functionality of BibTool, BibDesk compares adjacent values in the currently 
sorted column of the main publications list; if it finds an item whose value is identical in the succeeding cell, it selects
both items.  For instance, if you sort by first author and use @menutitle{Select Possible Duplicates}
and have four publications with the same first author, all of the four publications by that
author will be selected.  Obviously, author may not be the best choice in this case if you are
searching for duplicate publications!

@subheading Reviewing Duplicates

The number of duplicates found will be visible in the status line at the bottom of the window.
@emph{These are not necessarily identical items, however, so manual review is necessary.}
For easy review, choose @menutitle{New Group With Selection} from the @menutitle{File} menu,

@subsection Field Groups

@cindex field group

@subheading Features

Field Groups groups organize entries based on the contents of a certain field, 
the @samp{group field,} such as the @samp{Group} or @samp{Keywords} field.

In order to select a field to use as a group field, use the popup menu at the top of the list
on the left-hand side of BibDesk's window.  Add a BibTeX field name to this menu, or use one
of the existing options.  When you choose a group field from the popup menu, a list of all
possible groups is constructed, using the contents of the selected field for all entries in
your file.  

@subheading Example

Suppose you use the @samp{Keywords} field to group entries.  If you
have an entry with @samp{Keywords = @{models, constitutive relation, cohesion@}}
and another entry with @samp{Keywords = @{Models, constitutive, stress, cohesion@}},
your group list will show 6 groups: 
@samp{models, constitutive relation, cohesion, Models, constitutive, stress}.
A few points to note:  groups are case-sensitive, and partial matches are not accepted, and
one group (cohesion) will have two entries visible when it is selected in the group list.
Separators that are recognized for groups are @samp{;:,} and @samp{and}, at present.
@samp{and} will be ignored as separator when the entry contains any of the separator characters. 
The separator characters can be changed with a hidden preference using Terminal.app. 
To change it to, say, @samp{;,}, quit BibDesk and enter the following command in Terminal (exclude double quotes): 
``@code{defaults write edu.ucsd.cs.mmccrack.bibdesk BDSKGroupFieldSeparatorCharactersKey ';,'}''
then hit return.

You can add entries or files to a group via drag-and-drop by dragging the selected files to a
particular group's icon.  New items created in BibDesk are added to the presently selected group, 
but items dragged into the main publications list are not added to a group (think of the danger of
using @samp{Journal} as a group, and adding publications to that group!).

The default group separator is a semicolon followed by a single space @samp{; }, but this can be

followed by a single space, quit BibDesk and enter the following command in Terminal (exclude double quotes): 
``@code{defaults write edu.ucsd.cs.mmccrack.bibdesk BDSKDefaultGroupFieldSeparatorKey ', '}''
then hit return.

@subheading Editing

Field groups can be edited:  Changing the name of the group, will change the current value of
the current group field for all the items in the group.  In the case of authors, they will be matched 
using fuzzy logic, so be sure that you really want to change the author name for all items in the group!

For authors, you can get more info about the author using the command @menutitle{Get Info} 
(@cmd{I}) from the @menutitle{File} menu. 

Using the ``delete'' key to delete an item while a group is selected will result in the removal
of that item from the present group.  To delete the item from the database while a group is
selected, use @opt{}-delete.  To see the group equivalents for @menutitle{Edit} menu commands,
hold down the @opt{} key while the @menutitle{Edit} menu is displayed.

@node Smart Groups
@subsection Smart Groups

@cindex smart group
@kindex Option-Cmd-G
@kindex Cmd-I

BibDesk supports smart groups that dynamically change their content based on a list of
user-specified criteria.  To add a smart group, use the command @menutitle{New Smart Group} (@optcmd{G})
from the @menutitle{File} menu.  Additional search criteria can be added using the round ``+'' button,
and removed using the round ``-'' button, while the popup menu at the top of the panel can be used to
specify whether ``all'' or ``any'' of the additional criteria are matched.  This feature offers more flexible
searching than the standard Boolean quicksearch, and is always available.

The search criteria can later edit using thecommand @menutitle{Get Info} (@cmd{I}) in the @menutitle{File} menu, 
or in the contextual menhu for the group.  Its name can be changed after doubleclicking the group or 
choosing the appropriate contextual menu item. 

Smart groups are stored in the @samp{@@comment} field of your BibTeX file.  The format is that of a Mac OS X
XML property list, but you should @emph{not} modify the comment with a text editor, or rely on the format remaining
consistent across versions of BibDesk.  Some BibTeX editors may not preserve the contents of the @samp{@@comment}
field, unfortunately (early versions of BibDesk didn't preserve it, either).

Text-based fields are compared case-insensitively, for the criteria specified.  The BibDesk @samp{Date-Modified}
and @samp{Date-Created} fields are handled specially.  You can enter date ranges in various convenient ways.  
Date comparisons are automatically updated several times per day, so the relative comparison should
always be true.

@node Static Groups
@subsection Static Groups

@cindex static group
@kindex Control-Cmd-G

BibDesk supports static groups that contain an arbitrary set of items.  To add a static group, 
use the command @menutitle{New Static Group} (@ctrcmd{G}) from the @menutitle{File} menu.  
To add publications to the group, just drag the items and drop them on the group. 

@node External Groups
@subsection External Groups

@cindex external group

BibDesk can automatically fetch publications from external sources.  There are four types of external groups.  

Shared Groups contain items that others share on your local network.  
They are fetched using Bonjour.  This is similar to sharing of music files in iTunes.  
You can turn on sharing in the @ref{Sharing Preferences,Sharing Preferences}.  

External File Groups get their items from a remote URL on the internet or from a local file on your computer. 

Script Groups generate their items using a script, either a shell script or an AppleScript.  
For example, the script can download content from a remote location and parse the content to get the items.  
The script should return valid BibTeX. 

@ref{Searching External Databases, Search Groups} contain items obtained from searching an external database, 
such as PubMed or libraries allowing z39.50 searches. 

Items in external groups are not included in the Library and can not be edited.  
You can add external items to your Library by dragging them to the Library group.  
You can also use the @menutitle{Merge In External Publications} menu item in the 
@menutitle{File} menu. This wil only add items that are not yet in your Library.

@abstract{Syntax for searching z39.50 databases}

@cindex z39.50

To search a z39.50 database, simply enter one or more terms into the  
z39.50 search field:
@example
morgenthau politics
@end example
This will return all records that contain both @samp{morgenthau} and  
@samp{politics}. These search terms can appear in any field, 
and all the words are matched (each token is implicitly AND-ed.) 

To search for a phrase, put it in quotes:
@example
morgenthau "politics among"
@end example
To search in a particular field (see below for valid fields), enter a  
string of the following kind into the z39.50 search field:
@example
foo=SearchForMe
@end example
where @samp{foo} is an index specifying the fields of database records to
be searched, and @samp{SearchForMe} is the text string of interest. 

For example, a search for works written by Sewall Wright can be
conducted as follows:
@example
au="Wright, Sewall"
@end example
The indexes available in BibDesk are represented in the table
below. If a search supports relations, operators such as @samp{>}, @samp{<},
@samp{<>}, @samp{<=}, and @samp{>=} can be used, for instance, to search for works
published after a certain year. Note that, though the use of relations
is supported in BibDesk, many z39.50 servers do not support them.

For more information about MARC fields that are searched, consult OCLC's 
@uref{http://www.oclc.org/bibformats/default.htm,Bibliographic Formats and Standards} pages.

Boolean operators may be used to search several indexes at once, as in:
@example
au="Wright, Sewall" and ti="livestock breeding"
@end example
which will find works by Wright with the phrase @samp{livestock breeding}
in the title. When different indexes are used, Boolean operators must be included.

@node Syntax for Entrez Searching
@section Syntax for Entrez Searching
@abstract{Syntax for searching Entrez databases}

@cindex Entrez
@cindex Searching PubMed

Entrez databases use a search syntax closer to natural language than
does z39.50 databases. Enter key words, and the Entrez server will
generate a custom set of search results based on its retrieval
algorithms. Note that when searching PubMed for personal author  
names, @samp{,}
should not be entered between first names and last initials, and that
first initials (as opposed to first names) are typically used, as in
@samp{wright s} or @samp{fisher ra}.

For more focused searching, Entrez allows terms to be combined using
Boolean operators. According to the Entrez documentation, available at
@uref{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=helpentrez.section.EntrezHelp.Boolean_Operators,Boolean Operators},
these must be entered as follows.

@multitable {AND:} {}
@item @samp{AND:}
@tab Combine two search terms together to find all documents that contain BOTH terms.
@item @samp{OR:}
@tab Combine two search terms together to find all documents that contain EITHER term.
@item @samp{NOT:}
@tab Combine two search terms together to find all documents that contain search term 1 BUT NOT search term 2.
@end multitable

The Entrez search rules and syntax for using Boolean operators
are:
@itemize
@item Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT must be entered in UPPERCASE
(e.g., promoters OR response elements).
@item Entrez processes all Boolean operators in a left-to-right
sequence. The order in which Entrez processes a search statement can
be changed by enclosing individual concepts in parentheses. The terms
inside the parentheses are processed first as a unit and then
incorporated into the overall strategy. For example, the search
statement: @samp{g1p3 AND (response element OR promoter)} is processed by
Entrez by OR-ing the terms @samp{response element OR promoter} first and then
AND-ing the resulting set of @samp{documents with g1p3}.
@end itemize
Another way in which searches can be focused in PubMed is by the use
of extensions to the search terms. For instance, to search for @samp{random
genetic drift} in the MeSH terms field only, enter the following:
@example
random genetic drift [hm]
@end example
into the search field. Note that the extension appears in brackets
after the search key (@samp{random genetic drift,} in this case).

Other useful extensions include the following.

@multitable {lastau} {language (use the first three letters of the language's name, but not that "ja" means "japanese".)}
@headitem Extension @tab Meaning
@item au 
@tab Author
@item 1au 
@tab First author
@item lastau 
@tab Last author name
@item la 
@tab Language (use the first three letters of the language's name, but note that "ja" means "japanese".)
@item sh 
@tab MeSH Subheadings
@item dp 
@tab Publication date in YYYY/MM/DD format. Month and day are optional.
@item ti 
@tab Title

BibDesk can install a plugin that lets you search your database and
insert citation commands conveniently without leaving your text
editing application. @xref{Autocompletion} to install
the plugin and manage the applications that use it.

@image{gfx/autocompleteExample}

@subheading What does it do?

Autocompletion ties into the regular dictionary autocompletion of
words on Mac OS X 10.3 and greater.  In Cocoa applications (such as
TextEdit), you can type a cite key followed by a text fragment, such as 
@samp{\cite@{bib} and hit the F5 function key to get a list of possible 
autocompletion entries containing the text @samp{bib}.

BibDesk's autocompletion provides possible matches based on the Title,
Author, Citekey, and Keywords of your currently open BibTeX files.  To
select an item, hit tab, return, comma, or closing brace as
appropriate.

If BibDesk is not running when you try to use the autocompletion feature,
it will launch automatically, and the default bibliography will be searched.
If you have not set a default bibliography in your preferences 
(@xref{General Preferences}), you will need
to open the desired file manually in order for this feature to work.

Note that on laptop keyboards, the "fn" key must
be used to get the actual F5 key behavior with the default keyboard
preferences.  Alternatives are to use option-escape, which will also
trigger autocompletion, or to set up a key binding for the
@code{complete:} selector (TextExtras can be used for this, but see
the caveat below).

@subheading Bonus feature: reference completion

The autocompletion input manager will also provide completion for TeX @code{\ref@{} and @code{\pageref@{}
commands, based on all @code{\label} commands in the same text file.  For instance, 
if you have a table labeled "@code{\label@{tab:myTable@}}", you can type "@code{See Table~\ref@{tab:m@}}", 
hit the same key sequence used for citekey autocompletion, and see a list of all 
matching entries pop up.  The autocompletion looks for up to seven matching 
characters, so the more you type, the fewer options you'll be presented with in the list.

@subheading Caveats and known issues

There is a conflict with the @uref{http://www.lorax.com/FreeStuff/TextExtras.html, TextExtras 1.7}
input manager at present.  The author of TextExtras is aware of the issue and working on a fix, 
but the only solution at present is to remove TextExtras or install an unsupported 
@uref{http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/TextExtras_1.7BDSK.dmg, modified version}.

By default, @uref{http://itexmac.sourceforge.net, iTeXMac 1.3} does not support the keybinding for
autocompletion, but it can easily be made to work by adding a @code{complete:} keybinding to 
@code{~/Library/Application Support/iTeXMac/Key Bindings/TextKeyBinding.dict}.  
The following snippet binds control-u to autocompletion:

@code{<key>^u</key>} @*
@code{<string>complete:</string>}

@subheading Alternatives

For @uref{http://barebones.com/, BBEdit} users, Curt Clifton has written an AppleScript 
to provide similar functionality.  It can be obtained from 
@uref{http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cclifton/software.shtml}.  

For @uref{http://www.lyx.org/, LyX} users, Mark Reid has written an AppleScript to push BibDesk citations
to LyX, and his script is available at @uref{http://www.threewordslong.com/projects/misc/bibdesktolyx/}.

Users who develop similar functionality for other applications are encouraged to post their 
scripts and e-mail a link to @uref{mailto:bibdesk-users@@lists.sourceforge.net}
for inclusion here.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node System Service
@section System Service
@abstract{BibDesk System Services.}

@cindex system service
@cindex services

If you can't use the autocompletion plugin because your favorite text
editor is not compatible (for instance BBEdit or TextWrangler), you
will be able to use the installed OS X System Services to do much of
the same thing. 

The services also perform some searching functionality which can help
if you don't have a photographic memory of citation keys.

@heading Complete Citation

In any Services aware app (including: TeXShop, iTeXMac, TextEdit, 
BBEdit, and TextWrangler, but no Classic or X11 apps) type a
string, select it, then choose @menutitle{Complete Citation} from the BibDesk
submenu of the Services Menu. This will replace the selected string
with the citation(s) of any entries in open BibDesk documents (or, if
BibDesk is not open yet, in the default bibliography set in
@ref{General Preferences} Preferences) whose titles contain that
string. So:

@image{gfx/serviceBefore}

becomes:

@image{gfx/serviceAfter}

You can search more than just the title from the service.
Both of the next two examples search for the string ``foo'' in the title:
@example
"foo"
@end example
@example 
"Title = foo"
@end example

The next example searches for a publication with ``Baz'' in the
author, ``foo'' in the title, and ``Jan'' in the month:

@example
"Author = Baz & Title = foo & Month = Jan"
@end example

The @menutitle{Complete Citation} service uses a template for the 
actual output. If you want to use a different style, you can modify the templates.
See the @ref{Template Preferences,Template Preferences} to learn how to change the 
template file to use and @ref{Templates} on how to write templates. 

@heading Complete Bibliography

There are two other services available that can insert a more extensive 
bibliography description for the items. 
They work basically the same as the @menutitle{Complete Citation} service. Choose the 
@menutitle{Complete Text Bibliography} service menu item to get the bibliography 
as plain text. If you choose the @menutitle{Complete Rich Text Bibliography}, 
you wil get the biblography as formatted text (RTF). Both these commands also use 
templates. 

@heading Complete Cite Key

Another service is available, called @menutitle{Complete Cite Key} which allows
you to highlight a part of a citation key and BibDesk will complete
the key for you. For instance, in our example , selecting
``CasO'' and invoking the @menutitle{Complete Cite Key}
service would insert ``CasObe00''.

In order to use a non-default template the last menu item @menutitle{Using Template} should be chosen. 
This allows you to choose a template from a popup button in the save dialog window.

@cindex templates, customize

The default templates that BibDesk uses for Export and Services can be found in the folder 
~/Library/Application Support/Bibdesk/Templates. You can modify these templates to suit your preferences. 
If you remove any of the default templates, BibDesk will automatically replace it with the latest version 
on the next startup. 

For setting the templates used for export and services, or for adding completely new templates, 
see the @ref{Template Preferences,Template Preferences} help topic.

A template file is basically a file written in the format to which you want to export. However it contains 
so-called @emph{template tags}, which look a bit like standard HTML tags, apart from an extra $ before its name. 
When exporting, these tags are replaced by corresponding properties. 
For example, the template tag @code{<$fields.Title/>} will be replaced by the title field of the publications. 

The syntax for the template files is described in more detail in the @ref{Template Tags, Template Tags Appendix}. 

A single template can consist of several template files, distinguished by their role, as set in the preferences. 
Any template must always have a Main Page template file, which is used to create the data for the 
document. A template can have a Default Item template file, which can be used for 
creating the data for individual publications. If you want to use different templates for particular 
publication types (like article or book) you can add separate template files for those types. 

Furthermore, a template can have any number of Accessory Files, which are copied directly when exported. 
For example for HTML export, this could be an external CSS style file. 

If you want to use separate item template files, your Main Page template should 
contain the @code{<$publicationsUsingTemplate/>} tag. Otherwise, the Main Page template should contain the 
@code{<$publications>...</$publications>} collection tags.

@prefitem{Generate previews using TeX} (More appropriately, use pdflatex for previewing.) 
If this is checked, the preview pane will be drawn.

If you do not have a TeX installation, clicking the @buttontitle{Download TeX@dots{}} button brings you to a 
webpage that tells you how to get it. 

@prefitem{TeX Program Locations} The TeX and BibTeX program paths can be changed here, 
so you are not tied to one distribution of TeX. You must enter the full path to the binaries for
 pdflatex and BibTeX, e.g. @code{/usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current/pdflatex}.

@prefitem{BibTeX style} The BibTeX style file used for the previews (just the name, not the whole path) 
can be specified here.  This is a list of generic styles that may or may not exist on your system.  If
you need to use a style that is not in the menu, make sure it's in a location that TeX searches, (commonly
@code{~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bst}), and type the name of the style directly into the text box.

@prefitem{TeX template} Clicking the @buttontitle{Edit@dots{}} button lets you change the 
template file that is added to the beginning of every saved bib file. for generating the preview. 
This template file is a great place to put your macros, copyright info (if applicable), 
or shameless plugs for your software :) You can reset the template file to the default by 
clicking the @buttontitle{Reset@dots{}} button. Be careful though, as this action cannot be undone. 

@prefitem{TeX template encoding} The encoding popup lets you choose the encoding that is appropriate for the template file and the 
TeX program you are using. Note that the standard pdflatex and style files does not allow arbitrary 
Unicode characters. Therefore if you want to use other encodings then ASCII (TeX), you should

External autocompletion allows you to install a plugin which enables
bibliography-item autocompletion in Mac OS X 10.3 and greater using
the @buttontitle{Install} button.  

When the plugin has been installed, the button title changes to
@buttontitle{Reinstall} automatically. Autocompletion will only work in Cocoa
applications, such as the ones in the picture, and they must be added
to the list manually using the @buttontitle{Add} button below the list.  

If an application you have added to the list behaves strangely after
you add it, this is a clue that autocompletion is not compatible;
Apple's Stickies application is a good example of this.

@anchor{encoding-notes}
Specific notes and warnings:

* Files will be run through the @ref{Character Conversion} process when 
opened so that accented characters display properly.

* This is the default behavior in BibDesk 0.97.2 and earlier versions.

* Files opened with a given encoding will be saved with that encoding.  
 To save with an alternate encoding, choose the
@menutitle{File > Export > Export BibTeX With Encoding@dots{}} menu option and select a particular encoding.  

@prefitem{Unicode to TeX Conversion} Characters will only be converted to TeX when this 
checkbox for character conversion is marked. Otherwise, they are written out as displayed in BibDesk.
You can add @ref{Custom Character Conversions} by clicking the @buttontitle{Edit@dots{}} button. 
The custom character conversions can be removed by clicking the @buttontitle{Reset@dots{}} button. 
Be careful though, as you can not undo this action. 

The next four preference options control what data will be written when you save a BibTeX .bib file. 

@prefitem{Use normalized author names when saving} If you select this checkbox, author names 
will be saved in the standard BibTeX form 'von Last, Jr, First' in the .bib file. 
Note that author names containing macros will always be saved as they are entered, 
even if you select this option. 

@prefitem{Save Annote and Abstract fields at the end of the items} Selecting this option 
will ensure that the Annote and Abstract fields of any item is saved at the end of the 
record for that item in the BibteX file. As these fields can be long, choosing this option 
can restrict data loss on systems with restricted internal memory. 

@prefitem{Write template file at the front of every file when saving} If you select this 
option, the template file will be written at the front of every BibTeX file when it is saved. 
You can view and edit the template file by clicking the @buttontitle{Edit@dots{}} button. 
You can reset the template file to the default by clicking the @buttontitle{Reset@dots{}} button. 
Be careful though, as you can not undo this action. 

@prefitem{Automatically save RSS feeds} The RSS publishing preferences control the RSS export features. 
If you check this option, everytime you save a .bib file, a correspondingly named

You can open the Character Conversions Editor by choosing the 
``Custom character conversions'' button in the @ref{Files Preferences,Files Preferences}. 

@image{gfx/characterConversion}

BibDesk uses two sets of character conversions between TeX and Unicode. 
Conversions can occur in both directions, or they can occur only from 
Unicode to TeX. With the @menutitle{One-Way/Two-Way Conversions} popup you 
can choose the type of conversions to edit. 

The left column displays Unicode characters that BibDesk should convert to 
TeX. These can only be @emph{single} Unicode characters. 

Note that for two-way conversions, the TeX equivalent should @emph{always} 
start with @code{@{\} and end with @code{@}}. Therefore, the editor does not 
allow you to edit these characters when you are editing a two-way conversion. 

You can add a new character conversion by choosing the @buttontitle{+} button. 
Choosing the @buttontitle{-} button will remove the currently selected items. 

When you are done editing, you should choose the @buttontitle{OK} button 
to save your edits. If you choose the @buttontitle{Cancel} button, 
your changes will be lost. 

@subheading Notes

@itemize
@item If you want to convert a Unicode character to TeX that is not surrounded by 
@code{@{\} and @code{@}}, you can only add it as a one-way conversion.

@item A new conversion must first be made valid, before you can edit another entry. 
Note that duplicate characters are not allowed. In particular, you are not allowed 
to overwrite character conversions that BibDesk has defined internally. 

@item If you simply close the editor window, without choosing the @buttontitle{OK} or

Each template has one or more files associated to it. They are shown when you click on the triangle 
to the left of the template name. The right column for the files shows the role of the file in the template parsing. 
Each template should have at least a Main Page template, which is the main template file used to export 
all the publications. Optionally, there can be additional template files used for the individual publications. 
These are only used when the Main Page template file contains a template tag for @code{publicationsUsingTemplate}. 
In this case, there should be at least a template file with role Default Item. You can add separate item 
template files that are used for publications of a particular type, such as @code{book}. 
Furthermore you can add any number of Accesory Files, which are saved together with the exported file. 
For example, this could be a separate .css style sheet file for an HTML export. 

You can add new templates and new template files using the @buttontitle{+} button. Templates and template files 
can be removed using the @buttontitle{-} button. 

To change the file used for the template, double-click on the name of the file you want to change,

@cindex copy and paste
@cindex drag and drop

BibDesk can maintain a separate store of macro definitions which are not
associated with a particular document.  Many users store their @samp{@@string}
definitions in a separate file, or perhaps maintain abbreviated and full versions
of the definitions.  Unfortunately, BibDesk doesn't know about the relationships
between these files, so the macros are only shown in their abbreviated form 
unless they are added to the global macro definitions.

Macro definitions can also be found in bibliography style files (@samp{.bst}
extension), such as this example from @samp{apalike.bst}:

@example
MACRO @{ibmjrd@} @{"IBM Journal of Research and Development"@}
@end example

These definitions, along with @samp{@@string} definitions, can be copied and pasted
or dragged into the global macro editor window.  In fact, you can paste the entire
contents of a @samp{.bst} or @samp{.bib} file into the window, and it will extract
the relevant parts for you!

If you want to add these definitions to a file, you can copy and paste or drag and
drop them into a document's macro editor as well (see @ref{Editing a Document's Macro Definitions}
for more details).  A document's definitions will always override the global definitions,
in case of a conflict.

You can also add a collection of files from which global macro definitions will be 
read on startup. You will not see those macros in the macro editor, 
but they will be used when no other macro definition is found in the document or the global macros. 
You can add are either bibliography files (@samp{.bib} extension) or bibliography style 
files (@samp{.bst} extension). To add files from which global macros are read, click the 
@buttontitle{Files@dots{}} button in the Defaults preference pane.


@node Adding Custom Column Header Images and Titles
@subsection Adding Custom Column Header Images and Titles
@abstract{How to use custom images and titles in the table column headers.}

@cindex column headers
@cindex custom header images
@cindex custom header titles

By default, the main table shows the name of the field in the headers of the column, 
and for the @samp{Local-Url} and @samp{Url} fields it shows a small file icon and a 
@samp{@@} symbol respecitively. Sometimes you might want more columns to show images 
in the header tom identify the column, for example if you have added custom 
Local File or Remote URL fields in the @ref{Custom Types and Fields}. 


You can add your own custom image to use in the table column header. Let's say you have added 
a custom Remote URL field called @samp{Citeseerurl}, and you want the header for the 
corresponding column to a show an image which you have put at the location 
@samp{/Users/YourName/Library/Application Support/BibDesk/CiteSeer.png}. For Bibdesk to use this image, 
quit BibDesk and enter the following command in Terminal (exclude the outer double quotes): 
``@code{defaults write edu.ucsd.cs.mmccrack.bibdesk BDSKTableHeaderImages 
'@{Citeseerurl = "/Users/YourName/Library/Application Support/BibDesk/CiteSeer.png"; @}'}''
then hit return. You can add as many ``@code{Fieldname = "value";}'' pairs as you like 
inside the braces. 

Similarly, you can also replace the default field name by a title of your own choice, 
such as the @samp{@@} symbol for the @samp{Url} field. For this, follow the same procedure 
as for images, but use the key BDSKTableHeaderTitles instead, and write the title to appear in the 
header instead of the image path.

@prefitem{Duplicate Title Field to Booktitle Field for Crossreferenced Types}  In a potential parent
item, BibDesk can copy the @samp{Title} field over to its @samp{Booktitle} field, when you create 
or edit it. This is a workaround for a BibTeX problem, and was suggested by BibDesk users. 
BibTeX uses the @samp{Title} field of an @samp{incollection} and ignores the @samp{Title}
field of the corresponding @samp{book} type (the parent item).  Copying allows any child item to
get all of the necessary information from its parent reference.

Since this alters your bibliography, the features is off by default, even though existing
entries won't be overwritten.

@prefitem{Overwrite the Booktitle} Always overwrite the @samp{Booktitle} field when duplicating 
the Title field, even if it is not empty.

@prefitem{Types for which to duplicate}  Duplication will only occur when editing the
types in this list, which are considered the potential parent items.  Use the @buttontitle{+} 
and @buttontitle{-} buttons below the list to add and remove items.  
Note that you need to click the checkbox to enable duplication before you can edit the list.

@prefitem{Automatically Sort for Crossrefs when saving BibTeX files}  When you select
this option, BibDesk will automatically place parent items at the end of your file,
as required by BibTeX.  If you use CVS to track changes to your bibliography, be aware
that this feature may introduce a large number of differences in your file!

be applied.  This may be an absolute (fixed) or relative path.  Relative paths are
specified as a POSIX path relative to the document's path.

@prefitem{Papers folder location} Papers that are automatically filed by BibDesk will 
be moved to this folder or a subfolder. The format string used to generate the location of the 
moved papers is relative to this folder. When the papers folder is empty, the folder 
containing the document to which the items belong will be used. To get this behavior, deselect 
the checkbox.

@prefitem{Use relative path for Local-Url} When this option is selected, the Local-Url 
format will be appended to the BibTeX document's folder path; to modify this, insert a
relative path as the first part of your Local-Url format.
This option is only available when the papers folder is empty. When you choose this option, 
make sure that any document is saved before activating AutoFile. 

@prefitem{File papers automatically} When you select this option, BibDesk will automatically 
move files into the papers folder hierarchy for new items. The new location will be build 
using a format string, which you can supply using the other controls. 
See @ref{AutoFile} for more information about the Auto File feature. 

@prefitem{Local-Url Format} You can choose from several default cite key
formats. Choosing @menutitle{Custom} allows you to set the cite key
format string to any valid format.

For a more detailed control over the cite key generation, choose the 
@buttontitle{Advanced} button. This will reveal a editing sheet with 
the following additional items. 

@image{gfx/autoFilePrefs-Advanced}

@prefitem{Preset Format} This is a copy of the popup button in the main pane.

@prefitem{Format String} This text field shows the format string that is used to 
automatically generate new locations for auto filed papers. The Local-Url 
format string can contain several special format specifiers, which are
a %-character followed by a specifier character and optionally zero to
two numbers. See @ref{Autogeneration Format Syntax} for a
more detailed description of the syntax. The generated string is interpreted 
as a file path relative to the Papers Folder. 

@prefitem{Choose a format specifier to add} This allows you to easily
add format specifiers at the end of the format string. This popup
button will only be visible in custom mode.

@prefitem{Generate lowercase file names} Selecting this option will generate 
paths in all lowercase characters. 

@prefitem{Clean by removing} You can set additional cleaning of generated parts 
of the parsed format string. Braces are normally used in BibTeX to protect parts of 
a string from capitalization. You can choose to remove those braces from the 
generated cite key. You can additionally choose to remove TeX commands. This will 
also remove the braces. The Windows option will remove also characters that are illegal 
in file names on Windows systems, so you can share the files with a Windows machine. 
Choosing the Non-ASCII option will ensure that the generated file name contains 
only ASCII characters; accented characters are converted if possible.

@cindex automating tasks

You can use @uref{http://www.apple.com/applescript, AppleScript} to write small programs, 
or scripts, to automate common tasks in BibDesk. For example, you can have a script 
process all the titles of your references, cleaning them up or capitalizing them. 
Or you can use a script to download bibliography information for references from the web. 
Scripts can be made accessible from the @ref{Scripts Menu}.

Here is an example of an AppleScript to process the titles of all selected references. 
(The definition of the subroutine to actually do the processing is not shown).

@example

A more extensive sample of AppleScript support for BibDesk can be found in the script @samp{Sample Script.scpt}. 
You can view it through the @uref{Scripts Menu}. 

To see the AppleScript commands you can use with BibDesk, open "Script Editor" 
(located in @code{Applications/AppleScript}). In "Script Editor", choose 
@menutitle{File > Open Dictionary} (shortcut @shiftcmd{O}) and select BibDesk in the dialog. 
You can also drag the BibDesk icon onto the "Script Editor" icon to open the dictionary.

@cindex Scripts menu

BibDesk has its own AppleScript menu, and scripts dedicated to BibDesk can be stored
in your home directory under @code{~/Library/Application Support/BibDesk/Scripts}.

To quickly open the scripts folder, select @menutitle{About the Scripts Menu} from 
the @menutitle{About Bibdesk Scripts} submenu in the @menutitle{Scripts} menu 
(which is shaped like the AppleScript icon on later version of OS X). Scripts added to 
this folder will show up in the menu without relaunching BibDesk.
You can also use the @menutitle{About Bibdesk Scripts} submenu to view a sample 
script explaining the most important AppleScript commands you can use with BibDesk, 
and a sample @ref{Script Hooks} handler script. To view the source of these files, 
select the menu item with the Option key pressed.

@cindex script hooks

Sometimes you want to perform a particular AppleScript every time a certain action occurs. 
For example, you might want to have field that depends in a definite way on some other fields, 
so it can be handy if Bibdesk would auto generate this field for you. This is already built in 
for the Local-Url field and the Cite Key, but what about other fields?  As another example, 
you might want to commit a file linked by the Local-Url field to cvs or subversion 
whenever the file is moved by Auto File. 

For such times, BibDesk allows you to add custom AppleScripts that are automatically run 
when certain events occur. These are called Script Hooks in BibDesk. 

You can add Script Hooks in the preferences, see the @ref{Script Hook Preferences} 
preference guide for how to do this. The preferences also list the names of the 
various script hooks that BibDesk recognizes.

Go to the item linked below to see a sample script.

The main thing that should be done in the script is to define a 
@samp{perform BibDesk action with publications} subroutine to handle the script hook. 
An important thing to note is that you should bracket the whole subroutine in 
@samp{using terms from application "BibDesk"}, so that certain AppleScript 
definitions (such as the subroutine name) are recognized. 

For another sample script, look in the @ref{Scripts Menu} of BibDesk. To view its source,

The main thing that should be done in the script is to define a 
@samp{perform BibDesk action with publications} subroutine to handle the script hook. 
An important thing to note is that you should bracket the whole subroutine in 
@samp{using terms from application "BibDesk"}, so that certain AppleScript 
definitions (such as the subroutine name) are recognized. 

For another sample script, look in the @ref{Scripts Menu} of BibDesk. To view its source, 
select the @menutitle{Sample Script Hook} menu item with the Option key held down.

@node Character Conversion
@appendix Character Conversion
@abstract{Character conversions in BibDesk.}

@heading What is character conversion? 

BibDesk automatically converts many accented characters into their
TeXequivalents when it writes a BibTeX file. For instance, a u
with umlaut 
is converted to @code{@{\"u@}} when your file is saved, but presented as-is in
theinterface. There are some limitations on this process;
conversion only works when a @code{@{\} sequence is encountered, as in the
above example, and it only works if BibDesk has the conversion stored
in its internal dictionary.

@heading Accented characters and TeX 

The following table was taken from The
Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e> (Oetiker et al., 1999).
Depending on your TeX distribution, it may be available at
@code{/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/doc/latex/general/lshort.dvi}, 
or it is available from @uref{http://www.ctan.org/ctan/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/, CTAN}.

Many of the accents listed in this table can be applied to characters
other than o, as well.  

@image{gfx/accents}

Note: for BibTeX, it is also necessary to enclose the accent sequence in braces 
(see the @uref{http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=bibaccent, TeX FAQ}).

@abstract{The syntax of the format used for Cite Key and Local-Url AutoGeneration.}

@heading Syntax of the format

The format is used for autogeneration of certain values, such as the cite key 
and the local-url. The format is a string containing special format specifiers, 
which are replaced by strings determined by the bibliography data. 
Most format specifiers have the form of a %-character followed by a single character. 
It can be followed by optional digits, which serve as parameters for the format specifier. 
Possible format specifiers are given in the table below.

@noindent
In the table above, @value{paramdescr} characters after the specifiers 
indicate the optional parameters (the first number after an author specifier, 
the number of authors, should be a single digit). Indicated in the table 
are the parameter values that are used when they are not entered. 

The special value of zero for an optional parameter is interpreted either as 
@emph{all} (for the @samp{author}, @samp{title}, or @samp{field} specifiers), 
@emph{sufficient} (for the @samp{unique} specifiers, i.e., sufficient to create a unique cite key), 
or @emph{none} (for the @samp{random} specifiers). 

The format can contain only a single one of the @samp{unique} specifiers 
@spec{%u}, @spec{%U} and @spec{%n}. 

The optional parameters delimited by square brackets after an author specifier 
can be used to control the separator between author names and an optional @samp{et al.} suffix. 
For @spec{%A}, the first one is the separator between two author names, 
and the second one is the separator between the last name and the first initial. 

In the local url format the slash-character (/) has a special meaning, as it is used 
to build the (UNIX style) folder hierarchy. This is usually not what you want generated 
parts of the format to do. Therefore in the @samp{author} and @samp{title} slashes 
are always replaced by dashes (-) for the local-url format. The same replacement is also 
performed by default for the @samp{keyword} or @samp{field} specifiers. 
These latter two however can have an optional parameters delimited by square brackets, 
which can be used to set the replacement string to another value. In particular, setting 
the argument between brackets to slash (/), no replacement will be made. This is also 
the default behavior in the cite key format.

Because a number right after most specifiers is interpreted as an optional parameter, 
in order to use explicit digits right after a format specifier, one should use one of 
the escape specifiers @spec{%0}-@spec{%9}. 

The cite key format can contain, apart from the specifiers, only unaccented 
alphanumeric characters (a-zA-Z0-9), (semi-)colons (:;), dashes (-), slashes (/) or periods (.). 
Any generated part of the cite key will be converted to contain only those characters. 
For example, accents are removed and spaces will be converted to dashes. 

Keywords are, by default, separated by one of ;:, (semicolon, colon, or comma.) 
The precise way keywords are separated and how to change these defaults is described in @ref{Field Groups}. 

The format for the local-url can contain any character apart from colons (:). 
To use an explicit percent character, use the escape specifier @spec{%%} 
(except inside an optional argument delimited by square brackets). Also note the special 
treatment of the slash (/) noted above.

@heading What is encoding?

We will not attempt to answer this question in detail, other than to briefly present the practical 
ramifications of different character encodings. For historical background, see 
@uref{http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html, this article} or do a 
@uref{http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=what+is+character+encoding%3F&btnG=Search, Google Search}
on character encoding. It is assumed that if you use @TeX{}, you understand that if you use non-ASCII characters in a document, you have 
to pay attention to the character encoding and possibly use a special package that recognizes the text that you input. 

The basic problem at hand is that characters represented on disk as bytes can be interpred differently. 
Hence, opening a file that is UTF-8 encoded under the assumption that it is Latin-1 encoded can lead to a loss of 
information; some characters may not be read or displayed correctly, and if the document is 
saved in this state, the data is permanently lost. @TeX{} works around this problem by using 
@{\"u@} for the ``@ue{}'' character, since ASCII characters are essentially a  lowest common denominator 
among most of the existing character sets. 

@heading What encoding should I use?

In general, pick an encoding that will be compatible with all systems the document will be used on. 
On Macintosh systems in Western countries, the default encoding is MacRoman; this is understood by
all Apple computers, but users on other platforms may have difficulty reading the files 
(generally because they assume a different encoding). 
The UTF-8 encoding is a superset of ASCII, and is a more modern choice that supports extended 
character sets; it also works with @uref{http://scripts.sil.org/xetex/, XeTeX}, a Unicode-based @TeX{} system for Mac OS X. 
Windows computers (or users thereof) generally assume Windows Latin 1 or ISO Latin 1 (8859-1) 
encoding, which is a widely used character encoding for Western European scripts (but is incompatible with UTF-8).

@emph{The ``Non-lossy ASCII'' encoding provided by BibDesk should not be used unless you have a very specific
need for that encoding; it is not compatible with TeX accented character sequences, but some users
need it for other reasons.}

@heading Key Value Coding

BibDesk's templates are based on Key Value Coding, which is an intuitive way to describe properties of objects. 
We will not attempt to give a full explanation of this concept. We only give some general hints that will be 
useful for writing templates for BibDesk export and services. For more information, see Apple's 
@url{http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/index.html, Key Value Coding Guide}. 

@subheading Keys and Values

A key is simply a name for a property of an object. Keys usually contain just letters.

@subheading Key paths

Properties of objects can have properties themselves. You can find the property using a @emph{key path}. 
A key path is simply several keys joined together by dots. For example the following key path describes 
the property named @code{propertyKey} of a property named @code{valueKey} of some object. 
@example
valueKey.propertyKey
@end example

@subheading Collection keys

A property can sometimes describe a collection of objects. For example the key @code{publications} describes 
the collection of publication objects of a document. These @emph{collection keys} are handled slightly 
different from keys describing single values, both in key value coding and in BibDesk templates. 

@subheading Key paths for collections

The main difference for key value coding with collection keys is the meaning of key paths. 
For collections, the value behind the dot is the name of a property of the @emph{items} in the collection, 
not of the collection itself. For example if @code{collectionKey} describes some collection property and 
@code{valueKey} is the name of a property of the @emph{items} in the collection, then the key path @code{collection.valueKey} 
will describe another collection, which is made from all the properties named @code{valueKey} of the original items. 
For example, the key path @code{publications.title} will give the collection of all the @emph{titles} of the publications. 

When you want to get a property of the @emph{collection} rather than the items, you need to insert an 
@code{@@} at the beginning of the key. A collection can have two types of properties. 

The first type of property for a collection is a property that modifies the whole collection, returning a new collection. 
For example take a collection of all the fields of some publication. Then you can modify this collection by 
removing all the fields that have not been set. The key for this property is @code{@@nonEmpty}. So the full key path 
for all the non-empty fields would then be @code{allFields.@@nonEmpty}, which you can then use in a collection template tag. 
We call them @emph{collection modifier keys}.

Another type of a property for a collection is one that does not return another collection, but rather 
a single value property associated to the collection. For example, the key path @code{collectionKey.@@count} 
will give the number of items in the collection. We call those keys @emph{collection value keys}.


@heading Use of template tags

Key value coding is used in templates for BibDesk's templated export feature. An export template can contain 
certain special @emph{template tags}, which are similar to HTML tags, and are named by a key path. 
The main idea of the templating feature is that the tags are replaced by the value of the 
property described by the key path. 
There are three types of template tags: @emph{value tags}, @emph{collection tags} and @emph{condition tags}. 

@subheading Value tags

The simplest tags are @emph{value tags}. They simply describe a single property value, 
like the string value. The tags have the form
@example
<$valueKey/>
@end example

Or you can use a key path. 
@example
<$valueKey.modifierKey/>
@end example
You can often think of the extra components of the key path after the dot as @emph{modifiers} of the properties. 
For example assume that the property describes a string value. Then you could use a modifier key  
@code{capitalizedString} that simply capitalizes the string value. For example for a publication, you could use the 
template tag @code{<$title.capitalizedString/>}, which is replaced by the title of the publication written 
in capital letters. 

@subheading Collection tags

A more advanced template tag is used to enumerate collection properties. 
For example, in an export template, you might want to write out some properties for the collection of all publications. 
Collection tags consist of two tags, a start tag and an end tag. 
@example
<$collectionKey>
item template
</$collectionKey>
@end example
The @code{item template} that is written between the start and end tag is used as a template that is passed 
to the items of the collection. Keys in template tags appearing in the @code{item template} will be interpreted 
as names of properties of those items. 

You can also include a template that is used as a separator between items, which will be ignored after the last item of the collection. 
For this you need to insert a third template tag between the start and end template tags as follows. 
@example
<$collectionKey>
item template
<?$collectionKey>
separator template
</$collectionKey>
@end example

If a collection template tag appears by itself on a further empty line, this whole line will 
be ignored (but of course not the tag itself), including the newline at the end of the line. 

As we noted earlier, key paths for collection properties modify the @emph{items} of the collection. 
As they return a collection, we can use them again for a collection tag, as in the following example. 
@example
<$collectionKey.valueKey>
item template
</$collectionKey.valueKey>
@end example
This gives an enumeration over the values given by @code{valueKey} of the items in the collection. 

You can also use @emph{collection modifier keys} to modify the collection. As these still give a 
collection, they should be used in collection tags, as in the example below. 
@example
<$collectionKey.@@modifierKey>
item template
</$collectionKey.@@modifierKey>
@end example
 
Or you can use @emph{collection value keys}. As these returns a single value, it should be used in a 
@emph{value template tag}, something like the following. 
@example
<$collectionKey.@@collectionValueKey/>
@end example

@subheading Condition tags

Another template tag is used to include part of a template depending on whether a value is empty or not. 
For example, you might want to write out some property, and perhaps some more text around it, only when it is set. 
Condition tags consist of two tags, just as collection tags, but the key should be a value key.
@example
<$conditionKey?>
template for non empty condition
</$conditionKey?>
@end example

You can also supply a template when the value for the conditionKey is empty.
For this you need to insert a third template tag between the start and end template tags as follows. 
@example
<$conditionKey?>
template for non empty condition
<?$conditionKey?>
template for empty condition
</$conditionKey?>
@end example

Instead of checking for an empty value, you can also check for fixed values. 
@example
<$conditionKey=firstValue?>
template for match to firstValue
<?$conditionKey=secondValue?>
template for match to secondValue
...
<?$conditionKey?>
template for no match
</$conditionKey?>
@end example

Or you can match on substrings.
@example
<$conditionKey~matchValue?>
template for substring match
</$conditionKey?>
@end example

In these conditions the alternate template tags (starting with @code{<?$}) are optional. 
There can be an arbitrary number of alternate matches. Matches are case insensitive.

As for collection template tags, if a condition template tag appears by itself on a further empty line, 
this whole line will be ignored, including the newline at the end of the line. Moreover you can use 
key paths as well, as long as the combined key path returns a value key.

@subheading Properties of @emph{which} object?

We talked all the time about properties of objects. You can ask the question: of @emph{which} object are we taking a property? 
This depends on the context for our template. BibDesk can have two types of templates: 
the Main Page template file, and an Item template file. In the Main Page template file, the keys should describe 
properties of the @emph{document}. For example the @code{fileName} of the document. In an Item template file, 
the keys describe properties of @emph{publication} objects. For example the @code{title} of the publications. 

However in between @emph{collection tags}, the keys describe properties of the @emph{items} in the collection. 
For example, the following could appear in the Main Page template, as @code{publications} is the key for a collection 
property of a document. 
@example
<$publications>
    <$title/>
</$publications>
@end example
This simple template will write out all the titles of the publications in the document. 

For BibDesk there are essentially four types of objects. The top level @emph{document}, 
a @emph{publication} item, a @emph{field} of a publication and an @emph{author} of a publication.
