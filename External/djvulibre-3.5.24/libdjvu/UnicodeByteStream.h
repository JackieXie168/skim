/** ByteStream interface for an Unicode file. 

    Class #UnicodeByteStream# augments the #ByteStream# interface with
    functions for navigating Unicode documents.  It works in relation
    with a ByteStream specified at construction time. 

    {\bf Reading an Unicode file} --- You can read an Unicode file by
    constructing an #UnicodeByteStream# object attached to the ByteStream
    containing the Unicode file.
    
    {\bf Writing an Unicode file} --- You can write an Unicode file by
    constructing an #UnicodeByteStream# object attached to the seekable
    ByteStream object that will contain the XML file.

    Writing an XML file requires a seekable ByteStream (see
    \Ref{ByteStream::is_seekable}).  This is not much of a problem because you
    can always create the XML file into a \Ref{MemoryByteStream} and then use
    \Ref{ByteStream::copy} to transfer the XML file into a non seekable
    ByteStream.  */
