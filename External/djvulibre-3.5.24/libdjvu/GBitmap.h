/** @name GBitmap.h

    Files #"GBitmap.h"# and #"GBitmap.cpp"# implement class \Ref{GBitmap}.
    Instances of this class represent bilevel or gray-level images. The
    ``bottom left'' coordinate system is used consistently in the DjVu library.
    Line zero of a bitmap is the bottom line in the bitmap.  Pixels are
    organized from left to right within each line.  As suggested by its name,
    class #GBitmap# was initially a class for bilevel images only.  It was
    extended to handle gray-level images when arose the need to render
    anti-aliased images.  This class has been a misnomer since then.

    {\bf ToDo} --- Class #GBitmap# can internally represent bilevel images
    using a run-length encoded representation.  Some algorithms may benefit
    from a direct access to this run information.

    @memo
    Generic support for bilevel and gray-level images.

/** Bilevel and gray-level images.  Instances of class #GBitmap# represent
    bilevel or gray-level images.  Images are usually represented using one
    byte per pixel.  Value zero represents a white pixel.  A value equal to
    the number of gray levels minus one represents a black pixel.  The number
    of gray levels is returned by the function \Ref{get_grays} and can be
    manipulated by the functions \Ref{set_grays} and \Ref{change_grays}.

    The bracket operator returns a pointer to the bytes composing one line of
    the image.  This pointer can be used to read or write the image pixels.
    Line zero represents the bottom line of the image.

    The memory organization is setup in such a way that you can safely read a
    few pixels located in a small border surrounding all four sides of the
    image.  The width of this border can be modified using the function
    \Ref{minborder}.  The border pixels are initialized to zero and therefore
    represent white pixels.  You should never write anything into border
    pixels because they are shared between images and between lines.  */

      values of GBitmap #bm# at position (#x#,#y#) into the current GBitmap.

      #subsample#.  Each pixel of the current GBitmap can be covered by a
      maximum of #subsample^2# pixels of GBitmap #bm#.  The value of
      each pixel in GBitmap #bm# is then added to the value of the
      corresponding pixel in the current GBitmap.

      {\bf Example}: Assume for instance that the current GBitmap is initially

      then contains the sum of the gray levels of the corresponding pixels in

      levels.  Since there is at most 256 gray levels, this also means that
      #subsample# should never be greater than #15#.

      {\bf Remark}: Arguments #x# and #y# do not represent a position in the
      coordinate system of the current GBitmap.  According to the above
      discussion, the position is (#x/subsample#,#y/subsample#).  In other
      words, you can position the blit with a sub-pixel resolution.  The

/** @name PNM and RLE file formats

    {\bf PNM} --- There are actually three PNM file formats: PBM for bilevel
    images, PGM for gray level images, and PPM for color images.  These
    formats are widely used by popular image manipulation packages such as
    NetPBM \URL{http://www.arc.umn.edu/GVL/Software/netpbm.html} or
    ImageMagick \URL{http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/}.
    
    {\bf RLE} --- The binary RLE file format is a simple run-length encoding
    scheme for storing bilevel images.  Encoding or decoding a RLE encoded
    file is extremely simple. Yet RLE encoded files are usually much smaller
    than the corresponding PBM encoded files.  RLE files always begin with a
    header line composed of:\\
    - the two characters #"R4"#,\\
    - one or more blank characters,\\
    - the number of columns, encoded using characters #"0"# to #"9"#,\\
    - one or more blank characters,\\
    - the number of lines, encoded using characters #"0"# to #"9"#,\\
    - exactly one blank character (usually a line-feed character).

    The rest of the file encodes a sequence of numbers representing the
    lengths of alternating runs of white and black pixels.  Lines are encoded
    starting with the top line and progressing towards the bottom line.  Each
    line starts with a white run. The decoder knows that a line is finished
    when the sum of the run lengths for that line is equal to the number of
    columns in the image.  Numbers in range #0# to #191# are represented by a
    single byte in range #0x00# to #0xbf#.  Numbers in range #192# to #16383#
    are represented by a two byte sequence: the first byte, in range #0xc0# to
    #0xff#, encodes the six most significant bits of the number, the second
    byte encodes the remaining eight bits of the number. This scheme allows
    for runs of length zero, which are useful when a line starts with a black
    pixel, and when a very long run (whose length exceeds #16383#) must be
    split into smaller runs.
