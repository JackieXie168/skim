/** @name IFFByteStream.h

    Files #"IFFByteStream.h"# and #"IFFByteStream.cpp"# implement a parser for
    files structured according the Electronic Arts ``EA IFF 85 Interchange
    File Format''.  IFF files are composed of a sequence of data {\em chunks}.
    Each chunk is identified by a four character {\em chunk identifier}
    describing the type of the data stored in the chunk.  A few special chunk
    identifiers, for instance #"FORM"#, are reserved for {\em composite
    chunks} which themselves contain a sequence of data chunks.  This
    conventions effectively provides IFF files with a convenient hierarchical
    structure.  Composite chunks are further identified by a secondary chunk
    identifier.
    
    We found convenient to define a {\em extended chunk identifier}.  In the
    case of a regular chunk, the extended chunk identifier is simply the
    chunk identifier, as in #"PM44"#. In the case of a composite chunk, the
    extended chunk identifier is composed by concatenating the main chunk
    identifier, a colon, and the secondary chunk identifier, as in
    #"FORM:DJVU"#.

    Class \Ref{IFFByteStream} provides a way to read or write IFF structured
    files.  Member functions provide an easy mean to position the underlying
    \Ref{ByteStream} at the beginning of each chunk and to read or write the
    data until reaching the end of the chunk.  The utility program
    \Ref{djvuinfo} demonstrates how to use class #IFFByteStream#.

    {\bf IFF Files and ZP-Coder} ---
    Class #IFFByteStream# repositions the underlying ByteStream whenever a new
    chunk is accessed.  It is possible to code chunk data with the ZP-Coder
    without worrying about the final file position. See class \Ref{ZPCodec}
    for more details.
    
    {\bf DjVu IFF Files} --- We had initially planned to exactly follow the
    IFF specifications.  Then we realized that certain versions of MSIE
    recognize any IFF file as a Microsoft AIFF sound file and pop a message
    box "Cannot play that sound".  It appears that the structure of AIFF files
    is entirely modeled after the IFF standard, with small variations
    regarding the endianness of numbers and the padding rules.  We eliminate
    this problem by casting the octet protection spell.  Our IFF files always
    start with the four octets #0x41,0x54,0x26,0x54# followed by the fully
    conformant IFF byte stream.  Class #IFFByteStream# silently skips these
    four octets when it encounters them.

/** ByteStream interface for an IFF file. 

    Class #IFFByteStream# augments the #ByteStream# interface with
    functions for navigating from chunk to chunk.  It works in relation
    with a ByteStream specified at construction time. 

    {\bf Reading an IFF file} --- You can read an IFF file by constructing an
    #IFFByteStream# object attached to the ByteStream containing the IFF file.
    Calling function \Ref{get_chunk} positions the file pointer at the
    beginning of the first chunk.  You can then use \Ref{ByteStream::read} to
    access the chunk data.  Function #read# will return #0# if you attempt to
    read past the end of the chunk, just as if you were trying to read past
    the end of a file. You can at any time call function \Ref{close_chunk} to
    terminate reading data in this chunk.  The following chunks can be
    accessed by calling #get_chunk# and #close_chunk# repeatedly until you
    reach the end of the file.  Function #read# is not very useful when
    accessing a composite chunk.  You can instead make nested calls to
    functions #get_chunk# and #close_chunk# in order to access the chunks
    located inside the composite chunk.
    
    {\bf Writing an IFF file} --- You can write an IFF file by constructing an
    #IFFByteStream# object attached to the seekable ByteStream object that
    will contain the IFF file.  Calling function \Ref{put_chunk} creates a
    first chunk header and positions the file pointer at the beginning of the
    chunk.  You can then use \Ref{ByteStream::write} to store the chunk data.
    Calling function \Ref{close_chunk} terminates the current chunk.  You can
    append more chunks by calling #put_chunk# and #close_chunk# repeatedly.
    Function #write# is not very useful for writing a composite chunk.  You
    can instead make nested calls to function #put_chunk# and #close_chunk# in
    order to create chunks located inside the composite chunk.

    Writing an IFF file requires a seekable ByteStream (see
    \Ref{ByteStream::is_seekable}).  This is not much of a problem because you
    can always create the IFF file into a \Ref{MemoryByteStream} and then use
    \Ref{ByteStream::copy} to transfer the IFF file into a non seekable
    ByteStream.  */
