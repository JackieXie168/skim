/** @name DjVuPort.h
    Files #"DjVuPort.h"# and #"DjVuPort.cpp"# implement a communication
    mechanism between different parties involved in decoding DjVu files.
    It should be pretty clear that the creator of \Ref{DjVuDocument} and
    \Ref{DjVuFile} would like to receive some information about the progress
    of decoding, errors occurred, etc. It may also want to provide source data
    for decoders (like it's done in the plugin where the real data is downloaded
    from the net and is fed into DjVu decoders).

    Normally this functionality is implemented by means of callbacks which are
    run when a given condition comes true. Unfortunately it's not quite easy
    to implement this strategy in our case. The reason is that there may be
    more than one "client" working with the same document, and the document
    should send the information to each of the clients. This could be done by
    means of callback {\em lists}, of course, but we want to achieve more
    bulletproof results: we want to be sure that the client that we're about
    to contact is still alive, and is not being destroyed by another thread.
    Besides, we are going to call these "callbacks" from many places, from
    many different classes.  Maintaining multi-thread safe callback lists is
    very difficult.

    Finally, we want to provide some default implementation of these
    "callbacks" in the library, which should attempt to process the requests
    themselves if they can, and contact the client only if they're unable to
    do it (like in the case of \Ref{DjVuPort::request_data}() with local URL
    where \Ref{DjVuDocument} can get the data from the hard drive itself not
    disturbing the document's creator.

    Two classes implement a general communication mechanism: \Ref{DjVuPort} and
    \Ref{DjVuPortcaster}. Any sender and recipient of requests should be a
    subclass of \Ref{DjVuPort}.  \Ref{DjVuPortcaster} maintains a map of
    routes between \Ref{DjVuPort}s, which should be configured by somebody
    else. Whenever a port wants to send a request, it calls the corresponding
    function of \Ref{DjVuPortcaster}, and the portcaster relays the request to
    all the destinations that it sees in the internal map.

    The \Ref{DjVuPortcaster} is responsible for keeping the map up to date by
    getting rid of destinations that have been destroyed.  Map updates are
    performed from a single place and are serialized by a global monitor.

/** Maintains associations between ports.
    It monitors the status of all ports (have they been destructed yet?),
    accepts requests and notifications from them and forwards them to
    destinations according to internally maintained map of routes.

    The caller can modify the route map any way he likes (see
    \Ref{add_route}(), \Ref{del_route}(), \Ref{copy_routes}(),
    etc. functions). Any port can be either a sender of a message, an
    intermediary receiver or a final destination.  

    When a request is sent, the #DjVuPortcaster# computes the list of
    destinations by consulting with the route map.  Notifications are only
    sent to ``alive'' ports.  A port is alive if it is referenced by a valid
    \Ref{GP} smartpointer.  As a consequence, a port usually becomes alive
    after running the constructor (since the returned pointer is then assigned
    to a smartpointer) and is no longer alive when the port is destroyed
    (because it would not be destroyed if a smartpointer was referencing it).

    Destination ports are sorted according to their distance from the source.
    For example, if port {\bf A} is connected to ports {\bf B} and {\bf C}
    directly, and port {\bf B} is connected to {\bf D}, then {\bf B} and {\bf
    C} are assumed to be one hop away from {\bf A}, while {\bf D} is two hops
    away from {\bf A}.

    In some cases the requests and notifications are sent to every possible
    destination, and the order is not significant (like it is for
    \Ref{notify_file_flags_changed}() request). Others should be sent to the closest
    destinations first, and only then to the farthest, in case if they have
    not been processed by the closest. The examples are \Ref{request_data}(),
    \Ref{notify_error}() and \Ref{notify_status}().
