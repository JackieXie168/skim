/** @name GSmartPointer.h

    Files #"GSmartPointer.h"# and #"GSmartPointer.cpp"# define a smart-pointer
    class which automatically performs thread-safe reference counting.  Class
    \Ref{GP} implements smart-pointers by overloading the usual pointer
    assignment and dereferencing operators. The overloaded operators maintain
    the reference counters and destroy the pointed objects as soon as their
    reference counter reaches zero.  Transparent type conversions are provided
    between smart-pointers and regular pointers.  Objects referenced by
    smart-pointers must be derived from class \Ref{GPEnabled}.

/** Reference counting pointer.
    Class #GP<TYPE># represents a smart-pointer to an object of type #TYPE#.
    Type #TYPE# must be a subclass of #GPEnabled#.  This class overloads the
    usual pointer assignment and dereferencing operators. The overloaded
    operators maintain the reference counters and destroy the pointed object
    as soon as their reference counter reaches zero.  Transparent type
    conversions are provided between smart-pointers and regular pointers.

    Using a smart-pointer is a convenience and not an obligation.  There is no
    need to use a smart-pointer to access a #GPEnabled# object.  As long as
    you never use a smart-pointer to access a #GPEnabled# object, its
    reference counter remains zero.  Since the reference counter is never
    decremented from one to zero, the object is never destroyed by the
    reference counting code.  You can therefore choose to only use regular
    pointers to access objects allocated on the stack (automatic variables) or
    objects allocated dynamically.  In the latter case you must explicitly
    destroy the dynamically allocated object with operator #delete#.

    The first time you use a smart-pointer to access #GPEnabled# object, the
    reference counter is incremented to one. Object destruction will then
    happen automatically when the reference counter is decremented back to
    zero (i.e. when the last smart-pointer referencing 
    this object stops doing so).
    This will happen regardless of how many regular pointers 
    reference this object.
    In other words, if you start using smart-pointers with a #GPEnabled#
    object, you engage automatic mode for this object.  You should only do
    this with objects dynamically allocated with operator #new#.  You should
    never destroy the object yourself, but let the smart-pointers control the
    life of the object.
    
    {\bf Performance considerations} --- Thread safe reference counting incurs
    a significant overhead. Smart-pointer are best used with sizeable objects
    for which the cost of maintaining the counters represent a small fraction
    of the processing time.  It is always possible to cache a smart-pointer
    into a regular pointer.  The cached pointer will remain valid until the
    smart-pointer object is destroyed or the smart-pointer value is changed.

    {\bf Safety considerations} --- As explained above, a #GPEnabled# object
    switches to automatic mode as soon as it becomes referenced by a
    smart-pointer.  There is no way to switch the object back to manual mode.
    Suppose that you have decided to only use regular pointers with a
    particular #GPEnabled# object.  You therefore plan to destroy the object
    explicitly when you no longer need it.  When you pass a regular pointer to
    this object as argument to a function, you really need to be certain that
    the function implementation will not assign this pointer to a
    smart-pointer.  Doing so would indeed destroy the object as soon as the
    function returns.  The bad news is that the fact that a function assigns a
    pointer argument to a smart-pointer does not necessarily appear in the
    function prototype.  Such a behavior must be {\em documented} with the
    function public interface.  As a convention, we usually write such
    functions with smart-pointer arguments instead of a regular pointer
    arguments.  This is not enough to catch the error at compile time, but
    this is a simple way to document such a behavior.  We still believe that
    this is a small problem in regard to the benefits of the smart-pointer.
    But one has to be aware of its existence.  */
