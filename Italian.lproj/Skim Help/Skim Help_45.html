<p>Even though you can edit forms in PDF document that have them, those edits will not be saved. However, Skim allows you to save a copy of your PDF file that does contain the filled forms in the PDF data, by exporting it with embedded notes. This will also allow you to see the filled forms in other PDF viewers. However, after saving these edits, the forms will not be editable anymore.
