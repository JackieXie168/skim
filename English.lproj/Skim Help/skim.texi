Skim is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files, intended for easy reading and studying PDF documents.

You can search PDF files, bookmark them, add notes, highlight sections, and take "snapshot" for easy reference. Skim can also open PostScript (PS) files, converting them to PDF. 

In addition, with Skim you can fully concentrate  on reading the PDF file in a powerfull full screen mode, or give full screen presentations of your PDF file.

@topic Viewing PDF files

Skim can be used to open and print documents in Portable Document Format (PDF). A PDF file has elements of a printed document. Many PDF files are converted from printed documents, or created from the same source files as printed documents.

PDF files opened in Skim can be read, resized for onscreen viewing, and printed. You can search a PDF document for specific text, navigate some PDF files using a table of contents, select and copy text in the file, add notes and highlights, and give presentations.

If you open a PostScript (PS) or EPS file in Skim, it is converted to a PDF file.

@box{taskbox}
@heading To open all PDF documents in Skim:
@enumerate
@item In the Finder, select a PDF document.
@item Choose File > Get Info.
@item Click Open with:.
@item Choose Skim from the pop-up menu, and click Change All.
@end enumerate
@endbox

@box{taskbox}

@topic The text looks jagged in my PDF document

When viewing a PDF file in Skim, larger text may look jagged. You can turn on anti-aliasing in Skim to make PDF files more readable.

@box{taskbox}
@heading To turn on anti-aliasing:
@enumerate
@item Choose Skim > Preferences, and click Display.
@item Select the "Anti-alias text and line art" checkbox.
@end enumerate
@endbox

If you turn on the "Anti-alias text and line art" option, large characters and line art are smoothed out and do not appear to be so jagged. Skim may take longer to display your document when smoothing out characters and line art.

@topic Small text is unreadable in my PDF document

When you view a PDF file in Skim, small text may look fuzzy or illegible. You can change a few options to make the text more legible.

@box{taskbox}
@heading To make small text more readable:
@enumerate
@item Choose Skim > Preferences, and click Display.
@item Deselect the "Anti-alias text and line art" checkbox.
@item Enter a smaller number in the "Greeking threshold" field.
@end enumerate
@endbox

Text in a point size smaller than the greeking threshold appears as a gray blur. The blurred text fits the outline of what the text would actually look like, but is illegible. Displaying blurred text takes less time because Skim doesn't need to render each character individually.

If you turn off the "Anti-alias text and line art" option, large characters and line art may appear jagged instead of smooth. Smoothing out the characters and art takes more time.

@topic Emailing a PDF file loses notes or highlights

Notes and highlights you add to a PDF document are not saved in the PDF data, but are added to the file as extended attributes. Those are usually lost when you email the file. 

There are several ways to preserve the notes. Some compression methods preserve extended attributes. Apple's Create Archive unfortunately does not preserve them. You should compress and expand to test whether they are saved. You can also create a disk image to wrap the PDF file. Compression using tar and gzip also preserves the notes.

You can also save the notes to a separate .skim file. The receiver of the email can later add the notes to the PDF. 

@box{taskbox}
@heading To save the notes to a separate file:
@enumerate
@item Choose File > Export@dots{}. 
@item Select "Skim Notes" from the File Format popup, choose a location to save the notes to, and press OK. 
@end enumerate
@heading To add notes from a separate .skim notes file to a PDF file:
@enumerate
@item Open the PDF file.
@item Choose File > Read Notes@dots{}, and choose the .skim file that holds the notes. 
@end enumerate
@heading To create an archive of the PDF document:
@enumerate
@item Make sure you have saved the PDF file with the notes.
@item Choose File > Save Archive @dots{}, choose a location to save the archive to, and press OK.
@end enumerate
@endbox

It is important that the notes file is associated to the PDF file. Therefore it is best to choose the same file name for the .pdf file and the .skim file. In that case, Skim will automatically offer to add the notes from the notes file when you open the PDF file.

@topic Saving notes and highlights to a separate file

@topic Adding notes and highlights from a separate Skim notes file

You can have notes contained in a separate file with extension "skim", for backup or when the notes were send by email with the PDF file. 

You can add the notes to the companion PDF file. 

@box{taskbox}
@heading To add notes from a separate .skim notes file to a PDF file:
@enumerate
@item Open the PDF file.
@item Choose File > Read Notes@dots{}, and choose the .skim file that holds the notes.

It is important that the notes file is associated to the PDF file. If the file name for the .pdf file and the .skim file are the same apart from the extension, Skim will automatically offer to add the notes from the notes file when you open the PDF file.

@topic Saving PDF files with the notes and highlights included

Normally, Notes and highlights you add to a PDF document are not saved in the PDF data, but are added to the file as extended attributes. However, Skim allows you to save a copy of your PDF file that does contain the notes in the PDF data. This allows you to see the notes also in other PDF viewers. 

@box{taskbox}
@heading To save a copy of the PDF with notes included:
@enumerate
@item Choose File > Export@dots{}. 
@item Select "PDF With Embedded Notes" from the File Format popup, choose a location to save the PDF to, and press OK.

@heading Mailing List

If your questions aren't answered in this help file, the
@uref{http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/skim-app-users, skim-users mailing list} 
may have an answer. Your question
may have been answered already, so you can check the 
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=skim-app-users,list archives} 
to get instant gratification.

@heading Bug reports

You can submit a bug report to the bug tracker at 
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/skim-app}.

The reports are most useful if they provide a clear description of
what went wrong, what you expected, and how to reproduce the problem
at a different computer without you there helping us.

If you're submitting a problem with how it handled a certain file, it
would help if you sent that file too, or at least the representative
subset that causes the errors. Crash reports are also useful and can
be obtained from the Console application (in `Applications/Utilities`).
