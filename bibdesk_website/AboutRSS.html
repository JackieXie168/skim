		<ul>
			<li>Using RSS for research publications (aka, Why do I care?)
			<ul>
				<p>
					<li><strong>First, the short answer:</strong>
					<p>
					Because it's a great way to keep others up to date on your research. Using BibDesk's RSS features can help you do this with a minimum of extra work because you only have to keep your bibliography updated, and BibDesk will generate the RSS files for you.
				</p>
				<li>Syndicating your papers lists
				<p>
					By posting an RSS file generated by BibDesk, you can allow others to keep posted on your research. If someone subscribes to your papers list, they will notice in their <a href="#agg">news aggregator</a> when you post an updated version. They will notice if you change an entry as well as if you add new entries. All you have to do when you want to update your RSS feed is to export the bibTeX file using BibDesk and replace the old version on your web server with the new one.
				</p>
				<li>Using RSS to post papers lists for classes and work groups.
				<p>
					You can also use RSS to keep a list of papers you want your colleagues or students to read.
				</p>
				<li>Aggregating other people's publications lists.
				<p>
					As more people doing interesting research use RSS to publish their papers (and recommendations of papers), you will be able to stay on top of more new research by using an aggregator to notice new publications.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>This is much more efficient than trying to keep track of conference proceedings and journals in paper form!</em>
				</p>
				<li>Tips
				<ul>
					<li>Make sure to keep the Url field up to date, as this is used for the RSS link and allows the subscriber to quickly access the paper you're referring to.
					<li>Use the Rss-Description tab in BibDesk to enter custom notes about a publication that will appear in the RSS file.You can also set in the preferences to use a separate field for the RSS description. (eg, Title) Look at the screenshots linked to below to see how the description field shows up in a news aggregator. The publications in those screenshots have the description set to their title. 
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<li>What the RSS Format is
				<ul>
				<li>RSS is an application of XML that allows for syndication of news. It stands for Rich Site Summary, and you can find out more about it at <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0">purl.org</a>. Recently it has been adapted for use with weblog tools, such as <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> and <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a>. This means you can subscribe to a person's weblog and get updates when they add an entry.
				<p>
					<strong>NOTE</strong>: It's important to note that subscription doesn't require any resources from the person who is providing the feed. An application called a news aggregator periodically fetches the RSS file you post, and checks it for new items. So, as long as you post an RSS file somewhere accessible by http, people can subscribe to it! (You can also use the usual password protection for files via http to restrict the people who can subscribe, but that's outside the scope of this note. Ask your webmaster.)
