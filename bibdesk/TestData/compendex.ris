N2  - We determined interfacial areas, A, and individual mass transfer coefficients, k<sub>L</sub>, for the absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> in a bubble column, with an anionic surfactant in the absorbent liquid. The results of experiments to determine the dependence of k<sub>L</sub> on surface tension of the liquid phase and the superficial velocity of the gas were fitted to within a 10% error by expressions of the form k<sub>L</sub> = K<sub>4</sub> &sigma;<sup>1.35</sup> u<sub>G</sub><sup>0.5</sup> where K<sub>4</sub> depends exclusively on the kind of bubbling device. Likewise, the experimental values of specific area, a, were correlated with the column diameter d<sub>c</sub> and the physical properties by means the following equation: ad<sub>c</sub> = K&middot;Re<sup>0.98</sup>&middot;Sc<sup>0.57</sup>&middot;Fr<su p>0.09</sup> &middot;Bo<sup>-0.70</sup>(d<sub>p</sub>/d<sub>c</sup>)<sup>-0.1 9</sup> that reproduces satisfactorily the experimental values.

N2  - The ionic conductivity of the 0.5AgI&middot;xSbI<sub>3</sub>&middot;(0.5-x)Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</s ub> and 0.5AgI&middot;xPbI<sub>2</sub>&middot;(0.5-x)Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</s ub> glassy systems with a constant silver concentration has been investigated. It was found that the Ag<sup>+</sup> ion transport is closely related to the heavy metal iodide content. The conductivity activation energy decreases from 0.38 to 0.28 eV, and the room temperature conductivity increases by a factor of 100 with increasing x. A structural model based on available neutron diffraction, EXAFS and <sup>129</sup>I-Mossbauer spectroscopy data was proposed to explain the observed phenomena. &copy; 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - The <sup>13</sup>C pulsed ENDOR and NMR study of [meso-<sup>13</sup>C-TPPFe(OCH<sub>3</sub>)(OO<sup>t</sup>Bu)]<sup>-< /sup> performed in this work shows that although the unpaired electron in low-spin ferrihemes containing a ROO<sup>-</sup> ligand resides in a d<sub>&pi;</sub> orbital at 8 K, the d<sub>xy</sub> electron configuration is favored at physiological temperatures. The variable temperature NMR spectra indicate a dynamic situation in which a heme with a d<sub>&pi;</sub> electron configuration and planar porphyrinate ring is in equilibrium with a d<sub>xy</sub> electron configuration that has a ruffled porphyrin ring. Because of the similarity in the EPR spectra of the hydroperoxide complexes of heme oxygenase, cytochrome P450, and the model heme complex reported herein, it is possible that these two electron configurations and ring conformations may also exist in equilibrium in the enzymatic systems. The ruffled porphyrinate ring would aid the attack of the terminal oxygen of the hydroperoxide intermediate of heme oxygenase (HO) on the meso-carbon, and the large spin density at the meso-carbons of a d<sub>xy</sub> electron configuration heme suggests the possibility of a radical mechanism for HO. The dynamic equilibrium between the ruffled (d<sub>xy</sub>) and planar (d<sub>&pi;</sub>) conformers observed in the model complexes also suggests that a flexible heme binding cavity may be an important structural motif for heme oxygenase activity.
