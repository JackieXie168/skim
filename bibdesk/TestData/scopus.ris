AB  - Effect studies on marine life are changing focus from acute lethal effects to long term sublethal effects. There is a need for laboratory test systems that can facilitate continuous supplies of test substances at sublethal concentrations. Stability and reproducibility of the test solutions and application of test substances in mixtures are required. With the Continuous Flow System (CFS) described, the aim has been to make a flexible tool adjustable to a wide range of studies. Thus, test solutions and dispersions of substances poorly miscible in water can be made in various ways, using different methods and devices for substance injection, mixing and further conditioning. More than one species of organisms can be tested simultaneously. The system can be run both with freshwater and seawater. Presently the system is used for bioaccumulation and biomarker studies related to impacts of oil industry discharges of produced water off shore. This paper presents the main features and functional parts of the system and some result examples.

AB  - The term Urmetazoa, as the hypothetical metazoan ancestor, was introduced to highlight the finding that all metazoan phyla including the Porifera [sponges] derived from one common ancestor. Analyses of sponge genomes, from Demospongiae, Calcarea and Hexactinellida have permitted the reconstruction of the evolutionary trail from Fungi to Metazoa. This has provided evidence that the characteristic evolutionary novelties of Metazoa existing in Porifera share high sequence similarities and in some aspects also functional similarities to related polypeptides found in other metazoan phyla. It is surprising that the genome of Porifera is large and comprises substantially more genes than Protostomia and Deuterostomia. On the basis of solid taxonomy and ecological data, the high value of this phylum for human application becomes obvious especially with regard to the field of chemical ecology and the hope to find novel potential drugs for clinical use. In addition, the benefit of efforts in understanding molecular biodiversity with focus on sponges can be seen in the fact that these animals as "living fossils" allow to stethoscope into the past of our globe especially with respect to the evolution of Metazoa.
