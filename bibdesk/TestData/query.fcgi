TI  - Application of a forced-choice memory procedure designed to detect
      experimental malingering.
PG  - 437-50
AB  - The detection of dissimulated cognitive deficits is an important issue in
      many clinical assessment situations. Specific procedures designed to aid
      in this detection can be useful additions to standard assessment
      protocols. The present study investigates the potential utility of a
      modification of the forced-choice, symptom validity paradigm to the
      assessment of memory deficits. Previous research indicated that the
      procedure could discriminate between college students instructed to
      malinger memory impairment and college students instructed to perform at
      their best ability. The present study administered a forced-choice memory
      assessment instrument to 60 psychiatric patients, 60 normal community
      volunteers, and 60 neuropsychotogical patients. Thirty psychiatric
      patients and 30 community volunteers were given instructions to malinger.
      Discriminant function analyses yielded an overall correct group
      classification rate of 90.6%, with 5% of the nonmalingering subjects and
      18.3% of the experimental malingerers incorrectly classified.

TI  - Adult-onset hypothyroidism in a lynx (Lynx canadensis).
PG  - 287-91
AB  - A 19-yr-old female lynx (Lynx canadensis) presented for an acute onset of
      anorexia and reluctance to move. Physical examination, radiography,
      hematology, and serum biochemistry revealed evidence of renal failure,
      presumptive uremic gastritis, chronic intervertebral disk disease at
      T13-L1, and markedly low serum levels of total thyroxine (1.54 nmol/L) and
      total triixodothyronine (0.55 nmol/L). Twenty-five hours after its
      original presentation, the lynx exhibited horizontal nystagmus, which has
      been suggested as a clinical sign associated with hypothyroidism in
      domestic dogs. The lynx was euthanatized because of poor prognosis, and
      medical management concerns related to its chronic renal failure. Necropsy
      examination substantiated that the lynx had true hypothyroidism with
      60-90% of the thyroid gland replaced with adipose tissue. Although feline
      adult-onset hypothyroidism may have low incidence, it should still be
      considered as a cause of nonspecific signs of disease in cats, as well as
      signs suggestive of hypothyroidism. Routine monitoring of baseline exotic
      felid thyroid levels throughout life would help to identify normal values
      and diagnose a potential disease that has obscure clinical signs.
