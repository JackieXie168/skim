	This is the prototype for the CallCopyObjectFilterProc function which
	is called once for each file and directory found by FSCopyObject.
	The CallCopyObjectFilterProc can use the read-only data it receives for
	whatever it wants.

	The result of the CallCopyObjectFilterProc function indicates if
	the copy should be stopped.  To stop the copy, return an error; to continue
	the copy, return noErr.

	The yourDataPtr parameter can point to whatever data structure you might
	want to access from within the CallCopyObjectFilterProc.
	
	Note: If an error had occured during the copy of the current object
	(currentOSErr != noErr) the FSRef etc might not be valid

	containerChanged	--> Set to true if the container's contents changed
							during iteration.
	currentLevel		--> The current recursion level into the container.
							1 = the container, 2 = the container's immediate
							subdirectories, etc.
	currentOSErr		--> The current error code, shows the results of the
							copy of the current object (ref)
	catalogInfo			--> The catalog information for the current object.
							Only the fields requested by the whichInfo
							parameter passed to FSIterateContainer are valid.
	ref					--> The FSRef to the current object.
	spec				--> The FSSpec to the current object if the wantFSSpec
							parameter passed to FSCopyObject is true.
	name				--> The name of the current object if the wantName
							parameter passed to FSCopyObject is true.

	The FSCopyObject function takes a source object (can be a file or directory)
	and copies it (and its contents if it's a directory) to the new destination
	directory.
	
	It will call your CopyObjectFilterProcPtr once for each object copied

	The maxLevels parameter is only used when the object is a directory,
	ignored otherwise.
	It lets you control how deep the recursion goes.
	If maxLevels is 1, FSCopyObject only scans the specified directory;
	if maxLevels is 2, FSCopyObject scans the specified directory and
	one subdirectory below the specified directory; etc. Set maxLevels to
	zero to scan all levels.

	The yourDataPtr parameter can point to whatever data structure you might
	want to access from within your CopyObjectFilterProcPtr.

	source				--> The FSRef to the object you want to copy
	destDir				--> The FSRef to the directory you wish to copy source to
	maxLevels			--> Maximum number of directory levels to scan or
							zero to scan all directory levels, ignored if the
							object is a file
	whichInfo			--> The fields of the FSCatalogInfo you wish passed
							to you in your CopyObjectFilterProc
	dupeAction			--> The action to take if an object of the same name exists
							in the destination
	newName				--> The name you want the new object to have.  If you pass
							in NULL, the source object name will be used. 
	wantFSSpec			--> Set to true if you want the FSSpec to each
							object passed to your CopyObjectFilterProc.
	wantName			--> Set to true if you want the name of each
							object passed to your CopyObjectFilterProc.
	filterProcPtr		--> A pointer to the CopyObjectFilterProc you
							want called once for each object found
							by FSCopyObject.
	yourDataPtr			--> An optional pointer to whatever data structure you
							might want to access from within the
							CopyObjectFilterProc.
	newObjectRef		--> An optional pointer to an FSRef that, on return,
							references the new object.  If you don't want this
							info returned, pass in NULL
	newObjectSpec		--> An optional pointer to an FSSPec that, on return,
							references the new object.  If you don't want this
