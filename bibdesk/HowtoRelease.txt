How To Release BibDesk

- make sure that the BibDesk source directory has a copy of (unzipped) BibDesk.dmg
  *  the disk image has been prepared so that it opens in icon view
  *  the disk image has a background
- clean the project
- make sure vendor source is up to date and rebuild as necessary
- change version numbers
  *  Info.plist
  *  version.texi
- update release notes as necessary by reading commit-list messages
- commit changes
- tag the source using `svn copy https://bibdesk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bibdesk/trunk https://bibdesk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bibdesk/tags/REL_1_x_x` where REL_1_x_x is the new version number
- recompile the "BibDesk" target in Release configuration
- build the "DiskImage" target, which should drop a disk image on your desktop
- rename the disk image as e.g. BibDesk-1.x.x.dmg
- follow the sf.net release instructions
  *  you want to use "Add Release" for BibDesk or BibDesk-alpha
  *  name the release the same as the disk image (without the dmg part)
- edit the web page to point to the new release
  *  download URL
  *  release notes URL
- edit bibdesk-versions-xml.txt on the web server
- test the new download from the home page
- post appropriate messages to bibdesk-announce and bibdesk-users (someone should also post to macosx-tex)
