How to generate a release for BibDesk:

This file has been replaced by a wiki page at http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/piki/HowToRelease

* Preparation:

First, check that all desired changes have been committed, and that your local cvs tree is completely up to date.

Once all the changes have been committed, tag the CVS repository with the release tag. Release tags for bibdesk look like "REL_0_84" for version 0.84, for instance.

The command to do that is "cvs rtag REL_0_84 bibdesk".

Check that everyone agrees on a version number.

**note** - This info assumes you're using XCode, and I will probably be able to update it with the easy way eventually. Believe it or not, the next step was easier in Project Builder.

Go to the "Targets" group, click on the Bibdesk (Native) target. Press cmd-i to get the info panel. Go to the properties tab. Click the button at the bottom that says "Open Info.plist as File". In this file, change all occurrences of the version string to the new one. There should be 3 total.

Then go to the Resources subfolder, and click on InfoPlist.strings. Edit this to conform to the new version number.

Tell mike to change the file bibdesk-versions.xml.txt over on gradlab.ucsd. - he has added a bug to the DB to make it so that's not on his private web site anymore.

* Packaging:

Create a folder for the release. Add release notes, and the README. (Update the README if you have a lot of time on your hands!) 

I have a folder called "Releases" where I keep each version in its folder, named after the release number, so for instance "0.84".

Clean the active target. Set the build style to "Deployment". Rebuild bibdesk. Put the built app over in the folder you just created. Set your build style back to "Development" now or you'll get annoyed next time you try to debug.

Use the panther Disk Utility to create a new DMG from the folder you've prepared. It's the "images->new->image from folder" menu. Name the image "BibDesk-<versionnumber>"

Then go to the sourceforge page to create a new file release. Add a new release to the BibDesk package (or the alpha, if that's appropriate), name it the same as the archive. 

Then just follow the instructions from sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6445&group_id=1
"Guide to the File Release System" I usually have to re-read the whole thing every time I do it.
