Entering Accented Characters
-----------------------------

You can enter many common accented characters such as  and o directly, and 
Bibdesk will take care of translating them into the appropriate |LT| definitions when the file is saved.

They will also be re-translated upon reopening the file, so that you will see 
the intended character, not
the markup |LT| uses to generate it.
