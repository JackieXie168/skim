Introduction
============

Bibdesk 1.0 is a |BT| editor and reference manager. Because it is a |BT| editor, it is important to understand at least a few things about the |BT| file format.

* If you already have a |BT| database and are moving from hand-editing or another |BT| editor, start here: `For those already familiar with BibTeX`_.

* If you are just getting started keeping track of references or are moving from a program such as EndNote_ or another reference manager, start here: `For users new to BibTeX`_.


For those already familiar with BibTeX
--------------------------------------

Using BibDesk should be pretty natural for the average user of |BT|. Simply open a .bib file with Bibdesk and start browsing and editing. 

If you are used to writing |LT| code for accented characters and special fonts, you will be glad to know that Bibdesk handles most of that work for you now. See `Accented Character Translation`_. 

If you have a |BT| file that is not stored with ASCII encoding, see `Character Encodings`_.

Bibdesk can help you maintain useful and readable citation keys painlessly. See `Cite-key Generation`_ for more information.

Bibdesk supports |BT| macros. See Macros_ for more information.

Bibdesk does not currently take advantage of the |BT| crossref feature for display or searching, but if you use crossrefs, using Bibdesk will not break them. If you would like to send feedback about this, see `Getting Help`.

Now that you know about Bibdesk and |BT| support, you might like to skip the following |BT| introduction and get right to `the features`__.

__ `Bibdesk Features`_

For users new to BibTeX
-----------------------

|BT| database files are in a text format with a few conventions you will want to know. See `Formatting Names`_ and `Publication Types`_. 

It helps to know what the parts of a |BT| file are. Here's a trivial example to help illustrate. First we have a *macro definition*::

    @string{"PACT" = "International Conference on Processors, Architectures and Compilation Techniques"}

Next a single *entry*::

    @proceedings{pact02,
	    booktitle = PACT,
	    Year = 2002,
	    Month = sep,
	    Address = "Harvard Square"}

The terminology we'll use to describe the entry is as follows:

@\ *publication type*\ {\ *citation key*\ , *field name* = *value*}

Any value can be either a quoted string (using either "" or {}) or a number, or a macro (like PACT).

Publication Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each publication is assigned a type, which along with carrying some information about the publication, determines how it will be formatted later in conjunction with |BT| styles.

Citation Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Must be unique.

Field data
~~~~~~~~~~

Any field can be in any type.


Formatting Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Author and editor lists in |BT| files are written as a single string using the word "and" as a separator between names, like this example::

"Adam Maxwell and Michael O. McCracken"

If a name has two parts, commas are used to determine which parts are the first, middle and last names. For example, the following two names are the same::

"Adam Maxwell" "Maxwell, Adam"

|BT| also handles more complicated names. Prefixes to given names such as *van* or *van den* and suffixes such as *Jr.* or *III* are OK::

"van den Huevel, Johan A, Jr."


Macros
~~~~~~

Macro definitions look like this::
    @string{"PACT" = "International Conference on Processors, Architectures and Compilation Techniques"}

Macro uses just use the first part of the definition without quotes as the value for a field in the |BT| file.

Macros are a time saving feature that save typing when you have to repeat the same long journal name over and over. If you define a macro, you can just type the short version and |BT| will substitute the full version in processing.

Note that in our example, we also used a macro *sep*, which was not defined in the example. Common three-letter month names are usually defined appropriately in your `Style Files`_ for the document's language, and may also be abbreviated depending on the citation style.

Bibdesk supports reading, editing and saving |BT| macros. See Macros_ for further information.
