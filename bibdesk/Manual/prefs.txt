General
-------

<img src="gfx/generalPrefs.png" alt="" width=594 height=500>

This panel controls what BibDesk does when it starts up. Clicking the &#8216;Open this bibliography&#8217; radio button prompts you to choose a default bib file to open. You can set the font used in the publications list, and whether annotations or complete references are displayed in the bottom of the publications list.  Clicking the &#8216;Display errors panel for warnings&#8217; causes the Error panel to be shown at startup (see <a href ="help.htm">Getting help</a> for information on the Error panel).


Citation
--------

<img src="gfx/citationPrefs.png" alt="" width=594 height=498>


<em>Copying and Dragging Out</em>: This controls what gets dropped (or copied) on a drag (or copy).
<ul>
<li>BibTeX entry means the whole entry like: @misc{key, author="", ... , .... }.</li>
<li>TeX Citation means: \cite{cite-key}</li>
<li>PDF Description means essentially the contents of the Preview pane as a page of PDF.</li>
<li>Separate citations lets you choose whether to have bibdesk drop strings like \cite{key1,key2} or \cite{key1} \cite{key2} when multiple items are involved.</li>
<li>The citation text field lets you change the string that is used when dragging from the publications table to whatever you like (e.g. citep or citet ...)</li>
<li>Bracket Style lets you choose to use square brackets for copy/paste and dragging citations, for compatibility with ConTeXt.</li>
</ul>



<em>Custom Citation Drawer</em>: This allows you to enter further strings that you can access via dragging from the custom citation strings drawer. This drawer lets you drag the selected publications from the publications table, using a different citation string.



<em>Pasting and dragging in</em>: &#8216;Open edit window when paste/dragging in&#8217; lets you decide whether to always immediately open the edit window for an item you have pasted or dragged in.



Files
-----

<img src="gfx/filesPrefs.png" alt="">


<em>Default string encoding for opening and exporting BibTeX files</em>: This popup menu allows you to select the <a href="./charencoding.htm">encoding</a> used to open files by double-clicking on them in the Finder.


<em>Specific notes and warnings:</em>
<ul>
<li>Files that are opened as ASCII will be run through the <a href="./charconvert.htm">character conversion</a> process so that accented characters display properly.  This is the default behavior in BibDesk 0.97.2 and earlier versions.</li>
<li>Files opened with a given encoding will be saved with that encoding.  To save with an alternate encoding, choose the "File->Export->Export BibTeX With Encoding..." menu option and select a particular encoding.  Characters will only be converted to TeX when saving as ASCII files; otherwise, they are written out as displayed in BibDesk.</li>
</ul>

Preview
-------

<img src="gfx/previewPrefs.png" alt="" width=593 height=492>


<em>Use TeX for Previewing</em>: (More appropriately, use pdftex for previewing.) If this is checked, the preview pane will be drawn.


<em>TeX Options</em>: The style file (just the name, not the whole path) can be specified here. Also, the TeX and BibTeX program paths can be changed here, so you are not tied to one distribution of TeX.


<em>Browser preview pane</em>: Select what you want the lower pane of the main browser window to show.

Default Fields
--------------

<img src="gfx/defaultsPrefs.png" alt="" width=592 height=397>

<em>BibTeX Fields</em>: You can set fields to be added to publications by default here. They are added when a file is opened and if a new publication is made.<br>
Tip: Use this for fields you would like to use on every entry to avoid adding them every time. For example, a rating field or one that reminds you if you've read the cited paper.

<em>Template File</em>: Clicking this button sends you to TextEdit to change the template file that is added to the beginning of every saved bib file. This template file is a great place to put your macros, copyright info (if applicable), or shameless plugs for your software :)

RSS
---

<img src="gfx/rssPrefs.png" alt="" width=593 height=569>

Hopefully this panel is self explanatory. If you click on the &#8216;Find out more...&#8217; link, your favorite web browser will open the page <a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~mmccrack/AboutRSS.html">http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~mmccrack/AboutRSS.html</a>. The RSS publishing preferences control the RSS export features. If you check &#8216;Automatically save RSS feeds&#8217;, everytime you save a .bib file, a correspondingly named .rss file will be saved in the same directory. The &#8216;description&#8217; field in RSS is the text that shows up as the headline of each item in the RSS feed. See the link for more details.

CiteKey
-------

<img src="gfx/citeKeyPrefs.png" alt="" width=625 height=489>

<em>Preset Format</em>: You can choose from several default cite key formats. Choosing <em>Custom</em> allows you to set the cite key format string to any valid format. 

<em>Format String</em>: This text field shows the cite key format field that is used to automatically generate cite keys. The cite key format string can contain several special format specifiers, which are a %-character followed by a specifier character and optionally zero to two numbers. See <a href="citekeyformat.htm">Cite Key Format</a> for a more detailed description of the syntax.

<em>Choose a format specifier to add</em>: This allows you to easily add format specifiers at the end of the format string. This popup button will only be visible in custom mode.


Autocompletion
--------------

<img src="gfx/autocompletePrefs.png" alt="" width=594 height=423>

Autocompletion allows you to install an Input Manager in your home directory which enables bibliography-item autocompletion in Mac OS X 10.3 and greater using the "Install" button.  When the input manager has been installed, the button title changes to "Reinstall" automatically. Autocompletion will only work in Cocoa applications, such as the ones in the picture, and they must be added to the list manually using the "Add" button below the list.  See <a href="autocompletion.htm">Inserting References Automatically</a> for more information.


AutoFile
--------

<img src="gfx/autoFilePrefs.png" alt="" width=593 height=368>

AutoFile lets you choose a folder as your "Papers Folder" to automatically move files into when you link to them. You can do this to all files at once, or automatically as they are added. Use this preference pane to select the Papers Folder and to choose whether to automatically move files. See <a href="autofile.htm">Keeping Papers Organized with AutoFile</a> for more information.
