Autocompletion
==============


This help page describes how to use the Autocompletion feature to easily search bibliographies and insert references in Cocoa applications.
You will need to install the input manager as described in the <a href="prefs.htm#autocompletion">Autocompletion preference pane help topic</a>.


Automatically Inserting References
----------------------------------

Autocompletion ties into the regular dictionary autocompletion of
words on Mac OS X 10.3 and greater.  In Cocoa applications (such as
TextEdit), you can start typing a word and hit the F5 function key to
get a list of possible autocompletion entries; the arrow keys can be
used to scroll the list, and tab or return to select an item.
BibDesk's autocompletion provides possible matches based on the Title,
Author, Citekey, and Keywords of your currently open BibTeX files.  To
select in item, hit tab, return, comma, or closing brace as
appropriate.</p> <p> Note that on laptop keyboards, the "fn" key must
be used to get the actual F5 key behavior with the default keyboard
preferences.  Alternatives are to use option-escape, which will also
trigger autocompletion, or to set up a key binding for the
<tt>complete:</tt> selector (TextExtras can be used for this, but see
the caveat below). 


Bonus Feature
-------------


The autocompletion input manager will also provide completion for TeX "\ref{" commands, based on all "\label" commands in the same text file.  For instance, if you have a table with "\label{tab:myTable}", you can type "See Table~\ref{tab:m", hit the same key sequence used for citekey autocompletion, and see a list of all matching entries pop up.  The autocompletion looks for up to seven matching characters, so the more you type, the fewer options you'll be presented with in the list.



Caveats and Known Issues
------------------------

There is a conflict with the <a href="http://www.lorax.com/FreeStuff/TextExtras.html">TextExtras 1.7</a> input manager at present.  The author of TextExtras is aware of the issue and working on a fix, but the only solution at present is to remove TextExtras or install an unsupported <a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/TextExtras_1.7BDSK.dmg">modified version</a>.

>By default, <a href="http://itexmac.sourceforge.net/">iTeXMac</a> does not support the keybinding for autocompletion, but it can easily be made to work by adding a <tt>complete:</tt> keybinding to <tt>~/Library/Application Support/iTeXMac/Key Bindings/TextKeyBinding.dict</tt>.  The following snippet binds control-u to autocompletion::

<blockquote class="tightenable top bottom"><pre class="tightenable top bottom">
&lt;key&gt;^u&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;complete:&lt;/string&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
</font></p>

Alternatives
------------

For <a href="http://barebones.com/">BBEdit</a> users, Curt Clifton has written an AppleScript to provide similar functionality.  It can be obtained from <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cclifton/software.shtml">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cclifton/software.shtml</a>.  Users who develop similar functionality for other applications are encouraged to post their scripts and e-mail a link to the <a href="mailto:bibdesk-users@lists.sourceforge.net">BibDesk users's list</a> for inclusion in this list.
