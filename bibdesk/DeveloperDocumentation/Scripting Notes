- there is an experimental 'sdef' file for the script suite definition. We still need a build phase for that. The build phase should run a command like the one given in the file itself to generate the corresponding scriptSuite and scriptTerminology files.


- look at the BD Test and arXiv download scripts and try them in ScriptEditor to get an idea of the capabilities.

- There are comments with many of the new functions trying to explain what they do, their shortcomings and how they'd integrate better.

- None of the other files are touched. Everything is done via categories.


- for publications and authors should have some kind of parent property. 
-> For publications we currently use the first file - i.e. this won't work with multiple files
-> for authors things should be pretty safe. But the strategy of singling out authors like this isn't clear to me. is there supposed to be a central list (per file? per application?)

- getting RTF data out is broken. It does the wrong thing  and styling information is lost for some reason.

- There is sometimes no proper synchronisation between the updated data objects and what the UI displays. Particularly when adding / removing records


- when setting the record from BibTeX infortmation, the authors won't be separated out. (It's OK after reloading the file, but I try to do this correctly and fail - so something must be wrong.)
