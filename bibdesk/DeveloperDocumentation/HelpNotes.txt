Notes About the Online Help
===========================

Node splitting and navigation
-----------------------------

The AppleHelp pages are split according to *sectioning commands*, such as chapter, section, subsection. 
Note that this is _not_ typically according to @node commands. As @node commands are used for linking, 
every sectioning commands should be accompanied by a @node command. 
To allow navigation to lower level nodes, there should be a menu for those lower level sectioning items. 
We typically add these menus just before these lower level sectioning commands start. 
This leads to the following type of outlines (similarly for @section/@subsection):

<example>

@node Chapter Title
@chapter Chapter Title
@abstract{Short Description}

@cindex conceptual keywords

some text...

@menu
* Section Title:: short explanation
...
@end menu

@node Section Title
@section Section Title
@abstract{Short Description}

@cindex conceptual keywords

some text...

(other sections)...

</example>

It is usually also a good idea to add the @abstract command. 
This is a macro that adds <META> information that is used for searches. 


Menu and button titles
----------------------

Use the @menutitle and @buttontitle macros to write any menu or button title. 
Now they simply quote the titles, but this allows us to easily change the style if we want to. 

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

When you write keyboard shortcuts in the text, use the @cmd{}, @shiftcmd{}, and @optcmd{} 
macros. The argument is the key. Also add a @kindex command at the beginning of the 'node' 
to add an item to the key shortcut index. Use Cmd-, Shift-Cmd-, or Option-Cmd- prefixes for those. 

Preference items
----------------

To explain items in the preferences, we have paragraphs starting with a @prefitem{} command 
followed by some text explaining what the pref option is for. The @prefitem macro has the 
title of the item as argument. This should be the title appearing in the preference pane. 
The macro adds a colon at the end of the title. It also adds the item to the preference index. 
If you want to add an item to the preference index for which you have no title, 
use the command @prefindex. 

Texinfo help
------------

For more information about Texinfo see the online manual at

Screenshots
-----------

Make screenshots on a white desktop background. Screenshots in the Help are scaled to 
70% of the original size. 

There are 2 Gimp scripts in the distribution called crop-scale-background.scm and 
batch-crop-scale-background.scm to help with scaling and cropping of screenshots. 
They need a Gimp installation (e.g. Gimp.app). Put the scripts in ~/.gimp-<version>/scripts/. 
For individual images, you can use the "Crop Background and Scale..." menu item in the 
Script Fu > Utils menu in the image window of Gimp. For batch processing, use Terminal.app, 
navigate to the directory containing the screenshots (there should be no other .png files 
in the directory), and type the following line:

path/to/gimp/executable -i -b '(batch-crop-scale-background "*.png" 0 70)' '(gimp-quit 0)'

(I have aliased 'gimp' to /Applications/Gimp.app/Contents/Resources/bin/gimp to ease this).
