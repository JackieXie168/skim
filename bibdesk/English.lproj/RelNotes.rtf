\f1\b0 :  a new version of the autocompletion plugin is available, which fixes an issue for jurabib users in particular; use the Autocompletion (External) preferences to reinstall the plugin.\
\
Preferences have been rearranged and consolidated, but the online help screenshots do not reflect this yet!\
\
This version also has a new feature for adding references by selecting blocks of text from the clipboard or the web and adding them directly to BibDesk.  You can access the new feature from the Publication menu, but please check the online help for documentation of this feature (note the handy Help button on the sheet).

\f4\i\b\fs26 \cf0 Important:
\f1\i0\b0\fs22 \
- The input manager for autocompletion has been updated, and a reinstallation is recommended.  To update your installation, go to BibDesk's Autocompletion preferences, and click the External tab; the Reinstall button will update the plugin.\
\
- You can now rearrange the order of fields in your BibTeX entries, add fields on a per-type basis, and add completely new types.  There is no help available for this feature yet, and it is very new; we appreciate any feedback on it.  If you experience problems, remove the file ~/Library/Application Support/BibDesk/TypeInfo.plist and relaunch BibDesk.\
\
- You can now add character conversion definitions, so people who (for instance) use guillemets and german.sty can now define the conversion as they see fit.  For "Two-way conversions", the Unicode character must be represented by a TeX command sequence of the form \{\\xx\}, where xx may be any character or characters.  The "One-way conversions" do not have this limitation on the TeX command.  Online help is not yet available for this feature; if you have problems, remove the file ~/Library/Application Support/BibDesk/CharacterConversion.plist and relaunch BibDesk.\

\f1\i0\b0\fs22 \cf0   \'a5  Option added to save author names as normalized (off by default); see "Defaults" pref pane.  This converts names to "von Last, Jr., First" format.\
  \'a5  Option added to generate all-lowercase Local-Urls\
  \'a5  Optional parameters for separators and etal in format for author names (see online help for details)\
  \'a5  Added an option to display Abstract in preview pane\
  \'a5  We now (partially) support dragging Amazon pubs from Reference Miner\
  \'a5  Scale factor of the typeset previews is remembered in preferences\
  \'a5  We can now deTeXify arbitrary Unicode characters (at least as many as we can TeXify)\
  \'a5  Documents accept dragging/pasting RIS directly, as well as BibTeX; we sniff the pasteboard to see what the data type is\
  \'a5  Can hold down option key when dragging BibTeX into an editor window to overwrite all fields (not just empty ones); also fixes bug #1041479\
  \'a5  Character conversion errors now occur at a more easily-identifiable level, and you no longer have a prompt to send a notice to the bibdesk-develop list\
  \'a5  We now use a combo box for command history in the "Open Using Filter" panel, so the last seven commands are saved\
  \'a5  Added a menu item to the "Help" menu to show this file, in case anyone actually reads my deathless prose\
  \'a5  Macro definitions can now be dragged into the Macros editor table, and dragged between tables\
  \'a5  TeXification of fields is now an option in preferences\
  \'a5  The encoding of the TeX preview file is now an option in preferences\

  \'a5  The parser is no longer left in an inconsistent state after pasting/opening non-BibTeX data (fixes bug #1056263)\
  \'a5  Fix bug #1159901 by collapsing whitespace before setting pub authors (names aren't split properly if they contain excess whitespace)\
  \'a5  Fixed crashing bugs in btparse due to buffer overflow (in PCCTS); this could occur if you opened a long entry without closing braces\
  \'a5  Normalized names are again used for comparing authors, so the person view (list of an author's pubs) is now correct\

  \'a5  Hopefully fixed crashing bugs in UI updates (when searching?)\
  \'a5  Recognized "and" as a separator for keyword strings when reading a file, since ScienceDirect RIS uses it; autocomplete still requires ",:;" as a separator\
  \'a5  Author comma warnings are now displayed with some context, so you can fix them (bug #951913)\
  \'a5  Don't change menu item title for error panel (bug #1045902)\
  \'a5  Catch exceptions raised when autofiling papers; may prevent some crashes in BibEditor\
  \'a5  Removed leading underscores in private ivars and functions to comply with Apple's guidelines\
