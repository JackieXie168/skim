The Find window

You can search for a substring in any key listed with the Find command under the Edit menu (&#8984;F). BibDesk will look in every file you have open and display results in the Find window, where you can copy/paste, drag/drop, or double-click to edit them as much as you want.

Quick search
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The quick search field lets you enter sub-strings that might be in author names, titles or dates, and the reference view will display only matching publications. There are several built-in options. For example, All Fields (search every entry except the pub type at once), Keywords (search the keywords entries) and Pub Type (search by pub type).
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The quick search field is configurable by selecting &#8216;Add Field...&#8217;, which allows you to add any string you want to the menu. If a publication has that field, it will be searched. Adding the field &#8216;Cite Key&#8217; (with that exact capitalization) will allow you to search the citation key of publications. (All Fields also searches the citation key.)
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The quick search field has a memory. Across runs of the application, it will remember what key was being used, as well as which strings were in use for every key. If you press enter after typing a search string, it will also add it to a list of recent searches, as seen in this screenshot:
