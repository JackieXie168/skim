 		We will not attempt to answer this question in detail, other than to briefly present the practical ramifications of different text encodings.  For historical background, see <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">this article</a> or do a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=what+is+character+encoding%3F&btnG=Search">Google Search</a> on character encoding (strings are sequences of characters).  It is assumed that if you use LaTeX, you understand that if you use non-ASCII characters in a document, you have to pay attention to the character encoding and possibly use a special package that recognizes the text that you input.

		The basic problem at hand is that characters must be represented by numbers in a computer program, but different sequences of numbers can be used for the same character.  Hence, when opening a file that is UTF-8 encoded under the assumption that it is Latin-1 encoded can lead to a loss of information; some characters may not be read or displayed correctly, and if the document is saved in this state, the data is permanently lost.  TeX <a href="./characterconvert.htm">works around</a> this problem by using {\"u} (in BibTeX, anyway) for the "Ÿ" character, since ASCII characters are essentially a lowest common denominator among most of the existing character sets.

			In general, pick an encoding that will be compatible with other systems, if you need to share documents.  On Macintosh systems in Western countries, the default encoding is MacRoman; this is understood by all Apple computers, but users on other platforms may have difficulty reading the files (generally because they assume a different encoding).  The UTF-8 encoding is a superset of ASCII, and is a more modern choice that supports extended character sets; it also works with <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/xetex/">XeTeX</a>, a Unicode-based TeX system for Mac OS X.  Windows computers (or users thereof) generally assume Windows Latin 1 or ISO Latin 1 (8859-1) encoding, which seems to be incompatible with UTF-8, but this is a widely used character encoding.
