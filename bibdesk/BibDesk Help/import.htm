BibDesk expects a file with the extension &#8216;.fcgi&#8217; and of MIME type &#8216;application/x-Research-Info-Systems&#8217;. If you don't know what that means, that's OK. Just do your search as usual on PubMed, and then select the settings as in the following image:

The important settings are that it should be set to Display &#8216;MEDLINE&#8217; and Send to &#8216;File&#8217;. Then click the &#8216;Send to&#8217; button, and a file &#8216;query.fcgi&#8217; will be saved to your download folder. You can then use BibDesk to open this file. Once you have opened the file it cannot be saved back in the same format. If you want to, you can save it as a BibTeX file, or transfer the translated entries over into a BibTeX file that you use permanently.
