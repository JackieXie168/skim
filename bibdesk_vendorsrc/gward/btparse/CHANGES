Release 0.32 - 28 November, 1999
--------------------------------
* added tree-modification functions in modify.c (untested, undocumented,
  and unsupported) (feature suggested and implemented by Stéphane
  Genaud <genaud@icps.u-strasbg.fr>)
* fixed so 8-bit characters (128 .. 255) don't cause the lexer to
  get confused and declare bogus "illegal token" errors when parsing
  from a string (bug spotted by Stéphane Genaud <genaud@icps.u-strasbg.fr>)
* various minor code and documentation tweaks


Release 0.31 - 28 October, 1999
-------------------------------
* various documentation tweaks
* small bug fixes in format_name.c [dump_name()] and string_util.c
  [bt_change_case()]


Release 0.30 - 12 March, 1999
-----------------------------
* added name-formatting capabilities, and made many improvements in
  the name-splitting code
* added string "purification" and "case conversion" in the BibTeX way
* thoroughly overhauled error handling: it's now possible to catch any
  error/warning via an arbitrary error handler
* made lots of useful routines available outside the library (ie.
  prototypes in btparse.h, renamed with "bt_" prefix, and documented):
  mainly interfaces to the macro table and value post-processing
* changed definition of "names" (used for entry types, entry keys, and
  field/macro names) to be more like BibTeX
* added lots of documentation: bt_format_names, bt_macros, bt_misc, 
  bt_postprocess, bt_split_names man pages
* minor revisions to most existing man pages
* minor tweaks to the configure/build process


Release 0.21 - 20 October, 1997
------------------------------
* added an Autoconf-generated 'configure' script to improve portability
  to (hopefully) any and all Unix-like systems
* overhauled all the Makefiles and header files to use the information
  provided by 'configure'
* fixed a bug in bt_parse_entry(): library crashed if it was called 
  twice after hitting eof; now just issues a warning
* fixed a bug in bt_split_list(): got confused if any sub-string save
  the first or last started with the first character of the delimiter 
  (thanks to Reiner Schlotte <schlotte@geo.palmod.uni-bremen.de> for
  reporting this)
* fixed to only warn about double quotes in strings if they're at "top
  level" (to avoid spurious warnings about, say, umlauts in German words --
  another bug reported by Reiner Schlotte)
* changed bt_cite_key() (in traversal.c) to bt_entry_key()
* fixed an over-enthusiastic sanity check in add_macro(): reported an
  internal error where there wasn't one whenever a macro value
  started with { or ", or ended with } or " (thanks to Dirk Vleugels
  <vleugels@do.isst.fhg.de> for reporting this)


Release 0.2 - 8 September, 1997
-------------------------------
* fixed several small memory leaks
* fixed postprocess_field() so it correctly returns empty string 
  (rather than NULL) if the field is just a single undefined macro
* totally overhauled the lexer parser (and, consequently, large parts of
  the whole library) to handle @comment and @preamble entries on equal
  footing with @string and @"anything-else"; made provisions for
  eventually handling @modify and @alias entries once BibTeX 1.0 is
  released and its behaviour known
* probably lots of other changes I've forgotten about


Release 0.1 - 8 March 1997
-------------------------
* initial release
