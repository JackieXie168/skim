% a sample "regular" entry (ie. not a @comment, @preamble, or @string)

@book{abook, 
title = {A } # "Book",                   % an in-entry comment
editor = {  John Q.  Random} # junk,
publisher = {Foo Bar \& Sons}, 
year = 1922
}
@string(macro = "macro  text ",
        foo = {blah blah  } # " ding dong ")

% this is a lexical comment, which is never seen by the grammar and
% thus can't be tested (well, not yet at least)

@comment(this is a comment entry, anything at all can go in it (as long
         as parentheses are balanced), even {braces})
@preamble{" This is   a preamble" # 
          {---the concatenation of several strings}}
