* General information

  ziffy is a promiscuous Z39.50 APDU sniffer, like the popular tcpdump.
  ziffy can capture and show all Z39.50 traffic on your LAN segment.

  To perform its task ziffy needs at least two extra packages providing the
  following functionalities:

  (a) a portable framework for low-level network capturing facility
  (b) BER decoding, printing and freeing routines


  I compiled and run ziffy on my `explosive' linux intel based box with:

  (a) libpcap 0.4a6 API, Copyright (c) 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997
      by The Regents of the University of California


  (b) X/ASN.1 Toolkit 1.0.0, Copyright (c) 1989-1998 by Finsiel S.p.A.
  (c) YAZ Toolkit 1.7 API, Copyright (c) 1995-2001 by Index Data
  (d) SNACC Toolkit 1.3 API, Copyright (c) 1991, 1993 by Michael Sample and UCB

* Licensing

  The ziffy program is released under the terms of the GNU GPL, read the file
  COPYING for more information.


* Requirements

  ziffy depends on a couple of extra packages for working properly:

       - libpcap, the Packet Capture Library. It can be found at:

	 ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z


       at least one of:

       - X/ASN.1 Toolkit from Finsiel S.p.A. 
         contact us at zeta@tlcpi.finsiel.it if you need more information


       - YAZ Toolkit, the so popular "Yet Another Z39.50 Toolkit" from Index Data.

         You can find the YAZ Toolkit in:

	 ftp://ftp.indexdata.dk/pub/yaz/yaz-1.7.tar.gz

         for more information about YAZ please visit:
	 http://www.indexdata.dk


       - SNACC Toolkit, the "Sample Neufeld ASN.1 to C Compiler".

         You can find the most recent (1.3) version of SNACC at:

	 ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/freeware/snacc/snacc-1.3.tar.gz

         [
                old version 1.1, but commonly used, is in:
	      ftp://ftp.cs.ucb.ca/pub/local/src/snacc/snacc-1.1.tar.Z
         ]

         for more information visit SNACC home page:
	 http://www.fokus.gmd.de/ovma/freeware/snacc/entry.html


<PLEASE>
       If you know of other freeware ASN.1 Toolkits, please drop me a note.
       I will try to include them in all future versions of ziffy.
</PLEASE>



* Platforms

  Sun Solaris 2.5.1 and/or 2.6
  ix?86 Linux 2.0.X  (bug on it! be patient until I have time to fix it!)


* Installation

        o To compile ziffy, you need to build and install libpcap and the
          YAZ Toolkit or SNACC Toolkit first, or both at your choice

        o Run "./configure" if you have libpcap and SNACC/YAZ Toolkit on standard 
          places. Otherwise, to build from source distributions, run:

	  ./configure --with-pcap-dir=your_libpcap_location 
              --with-yaz-dir=your_yaz_location --with-snacc-dir=your_snacc_location

          "configure" will determine your system attributes and generate
          an appropriate Makefile from Makefile.in.

        o Run "make".  If everything is ok, you should have a binary
          called "ziffy".

	o Run "make install". everything will go to the right places.

<PLEASE>
        Please send me patches for any modifications you need to compile,
        install and run the program.
