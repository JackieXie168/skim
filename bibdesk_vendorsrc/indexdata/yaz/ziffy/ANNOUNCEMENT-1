--text follows this line--

      hi all,
I am pleased to announce the release 0.0.1 of the 'ziffy' tool,
a small utility program which can be of interest for the community.

`ziffy' is a promiscuous, and free, Z39.50 APDU sniffer.
It is released under the GPL License.

'ziffy' is available in source tarball format by anonymous FTP from:

ftp://zeta.tlcpi.finsiel.it:/pub/z3950/ziffy/ziffy-0.0.1.tar.gz


I have tested this tool on Solaris 2.6 and Linux (Debian `slink' 2.1).

Feel free to contact me for comments, suggestions, enhacements, ....

Hope it helps!

/rocco
