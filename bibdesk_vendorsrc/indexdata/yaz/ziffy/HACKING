                                                                   -*-text-*-

The ziffy utility started from its first version to use
GNU automake and autoconf utilities.

If you want to hack on ziffy, it will make you life easier
to have the following packages installed:

  - GNU libtool 1.3.3
  - GNU automake 1.4
  - GNU autoconf 2.13

These should be available by ftp from ftp.gnu.org or any of the
fine GNU mirrors. Beta software can be found at ftp://alpha.gnu.org.
                                                                

This means that you will need the usual GNU tools to build these in
maintainer mode from the development tree. You can simply type at
your prompt:

> ./autogen.sh

[a simple shell script that basically does the following for you: 

    aclocal
    autoheader
    automake --add-missing --gnu
    autoconf
    configure

]


have fun!
