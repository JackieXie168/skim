See the file LICENSE for details.

The primary output of the source here is the YAZ library, which
contains support functions for implementing the server or client
role of Z39.50 and SRU.

On Unix, GNU configure is used to configure YAZ and generate Makefiles.
Type "./configure", then "make" to build YAZ. Read
doc/installation.unix.html for details.

On Windows, a MS Visual Studio makefile is provided (nmake). The commands
  cd \win
  nmake
should do. Refer to doc/installation.win32.html for details.

Note: If you are using the CVS snapshot of YAZ you must have autoconf,
automake, libtool and xsltproc installed. Before running configure, create
support files by running buildconf.sh in the top-level directory of YAZ.  

In any case refer to the documentation in sub directory doc or read
it online at http://www.indexdata.com/yaz/
