    The <acronym class="acronym">COMSTACK</acronym>
    subsystem provides a transparent interface to different types of transport
    stacks for the exchange of BER-encoded data and HTTP packets.
    At present, the RFC1729 method (BER over TCP/IP), local UNIX socket and an
    experimental SSL stack are supported, but others may be added in time.
    The philosophy of the
    module is to provide a simple interface by hiding unused options and
    facilities of the underlying libraries. This is always done at the risk
    of losing generality, and it may prove that the interface will need
    extension later on.

     There hasn't been interest in the XTImOSI stack for some years.
     Therefore, it is no longer supported.
     </p></div><p>
    The interface is implemented in such a fashion that only the
    sub-layers constructed to the transport methods that you wish to
    use in your application are linked in.
   </p><p>
    You will note that even though simplicity was a goal in the design,
    the interface is still orders of magnitudes more complex than the
    transport systems found in many other packages. One reason is that
    the interface needs to support the somewhat different requirements of
    the different lower-layer communications stacks; another important
    reason is that the interface seeks to provide a more or less
    industrial-strength approach to asynchronous event-handling.
    When no function is allowed to block, things get more complex -
    particularly on the server side.
    We urge you to have a look at the demonstration client and server
    provided with the package. They are meant to be easily readable and
    instructive, while still being at least moderately useful.
