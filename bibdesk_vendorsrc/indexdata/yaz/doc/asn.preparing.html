    A structure representing a complex ASN.1 type doesn't in itself contain the
    members of that type. Instead, the structure contains
    <span class="emphasis"><em>pointers</em></span> to the members of the type.
    This is necessary, in part, to allow a mechanism for specifying which
    of the optional structure (SEQUENCE) members are present, and which
    are not. It follows that you will need to somehow provide space for
    the individual members of the structure, and set the pointers to
    refer to the members.
   </p><p>
    The conversion routines don't care how you allocate and maintain your
    C structures - they just follow the pointers that you provide.
    Depending on the complexity of your application, and your personal
    taste, there are at least three different approaches that you may take
    when you allocate the structures.
   </p><p>
    You can use static or automatic local variables in the function that
    prepares the PDU. This is a simple approach, and it provides the most
    efficient form of memory management. While it works well for flat
    PDUs like the InitReqest, it will generally not be sufficient for say,
    the generation of an arbitrarily complex RPN query structure.
   </p><p>
    You can individually create the structure and its members using the
    <code class="function">malloc(2)</code> function. If you want to ensure that
    the data is freed when it is no longer needed, you will have to
    define a function that individually releases each member of a
    structure before freeing the structure itself.
   </p><p>
    You can use the <code class="function">odr_malloc()</code> function (see
    <a href="odr.use.html" title="2. Using ODR">Section 2, &#8220;Using ODR&#8221;</a> for details). When you use
    <code class="function">odr_malloc()</code>, you can release all of the
    allocated data in a single operation, independent of any pointers and
    relations between the data. <code class="function">odr_malloc()</code> is based on a
    "nibble-memory"
    scheme, in which large portions of memory are allocated, and then
    gradually handed out with each call to <code class="function">odr_malloc()</code>.
    The next time you call <code class="function">odr_reset()</code>, all of the
    memory allocated since the last call is recycled for future use (actually,
    it is placed on a free-list).
   </p><p>
    You can combine all of the methods described here. This will often be
    the most practical approach. For instance, you might use
    <code class="function">odr_malloc()</code> to allocate an entire structure and
    some of its elements, while you leave other elements pointing to global
    or per-session default variables.
   </p><p>
    The Z39.50 ASN.1 module provides an important aid in creating new PDUs. For
    each of the PDU types (say, <code class="function">Z_InitRequest</code>), a
    function is provided that allocates and initializes an instance of
    that PDU type for you. In the case of the InitRequest, the function is
    simply named <code class="function">zget_InitRequest()</code>, and it sets up
    reasonable default value for all of the mandatory members. The optional
    members are generally initialized to null pointers. This last aspect
    is very important: it ensures that if the PDU definitions are
    extended after you finish your implementation (to accommodate
    new versions of the protocol, say), you won't get into trouble with
    uninitialized pointers in your structures. The functions use
    <code class="function">odr_malloc()</code> to
    allocate the PDUs and its members, so you can free everything again with a
    single call to <code class="function">odr_reset()</code>. We strongly recommend
    that you use the <code class="literal">zget_*</code>
    functions whenever you are preparing a PDU (in a C++ API, the
    <code class="literal">zget_</code>
    functions would probably be promoted to constructors for the
    individual types).
   </p><p>
   The prototype for the individual PDU types generally look like this:
   </p><pre class="synopsis">
    Z_&lt;type&gt; *zget_&lt;type&gt;(ODR o);
   </pre><p>
    eg.:
   </p><pre class="synopsis">
    Z_InitRequest *zget_InitRequest(ODR o);
   </pre><p>
   The <acronym class="acronym">ODR</acronym> handle should generally be your encoding stream, but it
    needn't be.
   </p><p>
   As well as the individual PDU functions, a function
    <code class="function">zget_APDU()</code> is provided, which allocates
    a top-level Z-APDU of the type requested:
   </p><pre class="synopsis">
    Z_APDU *zget_APDU(ODR o, int which);
   </pre><p>
    The <code class="varname">which</code> parameter is (of course) the discriminator
    belonging to the <code class="varname">Z_APDU</code> <code class="literal">CHOICE</code> type.
    All of the interface described here is provided by the Z39.50 ASN.1 module, and
    you access it through the <code class="filename">proto.h</code> header file.
