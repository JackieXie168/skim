@implementation OFReadWriteLock
/*"
OFReadWriteLock provides a mechanism by which multiple readers can obtain access to a resource at the same time but only a single writer may obtain access to that resource.  The writer and readers cannot have ownership of the lock at the same time.  This lock is useful when the resource being guarded will usually be read-only but will occasionally be updated.  Rather than using an NSLock (which only allows a single owner at any time, this will allow the readers to proceed through the critical section with little contention.

Note that OFReadWriteLock does <b>not</b> allow upgrading read-locks to write-locks atomically.  You might imagine a scenario where if there is a single active reader and it is attempting to upgrade to a write-lock, that would be permitted.  This is not possible to implement in general though.  Consider the case were two threads have obtained read-locks.  If at some later point both of the threads attempt to upgrade to write-locks, the application will deadlock and the two threads wait on each other.

It would be possible to implement this if there was a method '-lockForReadingWithPotentialForUpgradeToWriteLock'.  This method would allow other readers until the point that the thread upgraded to a write lock, but no other thread would be allowed to take out a write lock or a potentially upgrading write lock.  This would be more complicated, though, so we've not bothered implemented this yet.
