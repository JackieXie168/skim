// Arithmetic using NSNumbers. This was originally written OO-style, as a method for each operation, but it turns out what we really need is some sort of polymorphic dispatch a la Common Lisp; there's no good way to represent that in ObjC. So, since we have to special-case all the polymorphism anyway, just make it a single fn. (The especial complication here is the need to support OFRationalNumbers.)

// This class exists due to Radar #3478597 where NaN numbers aren't correctly compared.  This returns something that is truly 'Not a Number' and thus the CF comparison works out better.  Of course, it really isn't a NSNumber, so care must be taken that it isn't used as one.
