/*" Often an algorithm that deals with streams of data may need a lot of temporary data buffers.  OmniSampler shows that a great deal of time can be wasted in these cases in the overhead of allocating and deallocating memory from the kernel and clearing it.

OFFastMutableData is an an attempt to get rid of this overhead.  We maintain a pool of available buffers and we never zero them when they are allocated.

Right now we don't have optimized retain counting for these instances.  The major expense seems to be in the system call and in zeroing the bytes.

Also, the current algorithm never frees buffers.  This can lead to memory space being wasted if the buffer sizes or usage changes during a program.  It might be better to have pools of fast mutable data objects.  An algorithm could create a pool and use it for a while and when it was done, clean up all of the instances.
