This is called on each class implementation with this selector name the first time the application is about to become multi-threaded.  Classes can implement this method to allocate locks that will be necessary to arbitrate access to shared data owned by the class.  This method is NOT automatically called on instances -- they will need to manually subscribe to NSWillBecomeMultiThreadedNotification.
