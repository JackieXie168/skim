#import <AppKit/NSPopUpButton.h>
#import <AppKit/NSNibDeclarations.h> // For IBOutlet

@class NSTextField;
@class OATypeAheadSelectionHelper;

// This class adds two features to NSPopUpButton.
// The first, also found in other OmniAppKit controls, adds a label outlet, intended to be hooked up to a TextField which contains an explanatory label for the control. As per Aqua HIG, OAPopUpButton will change the text color of its associated label field to reflect its own enabled/disabled state.
// Also, OAPopUpButton will allow users to select items in its menu by typing the first few letters. It's a lot easier to tab to the popup (with keyboard UI enabled) and type "wa" than to manually select which state you live in. 

@interface OAPopUpButton : NSPopUpButton
{
    IBOutlet NSTextField *label;
    
    OATypeAheadSelectionHelper *typeAheadHelper;
}
