# This file defines how LaTeX fonts are translated to fonts in the RTF file.
# Each line consists of a LaTeX font name, a comma, the RTF font name, and a period.
#
# Text after a sharp (#) is ignored to the end of the line.
# For repeated LaTeX font names, only the first is used.
# Any font in the LaTeX file not mentioned is mapped to the default font.
# All RTF fonts listed in this file will be in every RTF file header whether used or not.
# No spaces before or after the comma are allowed
#
# Dummy and Dummy2 have been added to improve translation of symbols. 
# These should not be deleted.  Additional symbol fonts can be added
# by defining e.g., Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.  Dummy3 can then be used
# in direct.cfg to handle other symbols.
#
# The default LaTeX fonts are 
#    Roman (\rm)
#    Slanted (\sl)
#    Sans Serif (\sf)
#    Typewriter (\tt)
#
# W. Hennings 2003-03-28:
# a)Substitutes for Roman, Slanted, Sans Serif and Typewriter
# changed to the standard MS Windows fonts.
#
# b)Substitute for following fonts changed to using 
# Microsoft's "core fonts" (supplied with MS Office and downloadable from 
# http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/offeurofonts.aspx ):
# Roman1: "Palatino" changed to "Book Antiqua"
# Roman2: "Bookman" changed to "Bookman Old Style"
# Roman3: "Avant Garde" changed to "Century Gothic"
# 
# c)You may also have to change the following, 
# according to what fonts you have on your system:
# Calligraphic: "Zapf Chancery" to whatsoever-you-have.
# Roman4: "New Century Schoolbook" to "Century Schoolbook"
#
# Changed 17 March 2004 by amaxwell@users.sourceforge.net  to
# make font names compatible with Apple TextEdit,
# since Times New Roman is non-standard, and Apple's Helvetica
# does not have an italic shape.  I found the names by saving
# files from TextEdit, then looking at the RTF with vi.  Some
# names have a dash, some do not...strange. 
# Note that MS Word still works with these changes.
