latex2rtf is a translator program that translates LaTeX text into the
RTF format used by various text processors, most notably Word.

For the Copyright of the Program see the file Copyright.

bitmaps.  This requires TeX and ImageMagick.  See scripts/README.

To install (on a UNIX system)
- Edit Makefile for your local configuration.  The default install
  is reasonable, but if you do not have root access, then you might
  need to set $PREFIX to be your home directory.
- make
- If this is not your first-time installation, you may want to preserve
  your old configuration (*.cfg) files. Copy them to a safe place before
  installing.
- make check   (expect warnings but no errors)
- make install
