<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>LaTeX2RTF
 is a translator program from LaTeX
 text into &ldquo;rich text format&rdquo; files.  These
files are commonly referred to as RTF files.  RTF is a published standard format by
Microsoft.  This standard can be ambiguous in places and Microsoft ignores
parts of the standard it finds inconvenient, but RTF is widely used by many WYSIWIG text
editors and is supported by Microsoft Word and most text processors.

<p>LaTeX2RTF
 translates the text and as much of the formatting information from LaTeX
 to RTF. 
Be forewarned that the typeset output is not nearly as good as what you would get
from using LaTeX
 directly. 
So, why bother translating? Consider,

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>You use LaTeX
 and hate everything beginning with MS-<small class="enddots">....</small> Nevertheless, you have
to share your documents with people who don't even now that there exist other things than
MS-<small class="enddots">....</small>

     <li>You know somebody who frequently sends you very fine LaTeX
 documents. Unfortunately,
you are &ldquo;on the other side&rdquo; and need to import her files, steal some part, and then
desktop publish it in your fine MS-<small class="dots">...</small> environment.

     </ol>

   <p>There are drawbacks to the conversion process. In fact, don't expect any LaTeX
 file to
be converted as you would like, don't expect it to be converted without errors or
warnings, and don't be especially surprised when it doesn't convert at all.  LaTeX2RTF
 is
known to have many bugs and many missing features. Paradoxically, this number seems to
grow more and more with each day.  However, we can categorically state that there are some
special cases,  in which a LaTeX
 file will be translated to RTF satisfactorily by
LaTeX2RTF
 &mdash; This was sort of disclaimer, ok? OK!

   <p>LaTeX
 is a system for typesetting text and therefore it focuses on the logical
structure of a document, whilst RTF is meant to be a transport format for a family of
Desktop Publishing Software, dealing mostly with the design of a text.

   <p>Although the possible different commands and styles in LaTeX
 are much more flexible and
standardized than in RTF, only a small subset of commands has been implemented to date. 
See <a href="#Unimplemented-Features">Unimplemented Features</a>.

   <p>Some of the capabilities of LaTeX2RTF
 are restricted in scope or buggy. See <a href="#Known-Bugs">Known Bugs</a>.

   <p>RTF is a moving target, because Microsoft does not stop inventing new extensions and
features, consequently you cannot view newer RTF files with older word processors. 
The syntax and
semantics of RTF are somewhat artistic, i.e., you can generate a syntactically correct RTF
file that cannot be displayed by some/most word processors. 
For more details on RTF the specification consult the links at <a href="http://latex2rtf.sf.net/">http://latex2rtf.sf.net/</a>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Obtaining LaTeX2RTF</h3>

<p>LaTeX2RTF
 is available for many Unix Platforms, for the Macintosh, and for MS-DOS, including
all versions of MS Windows.

<p>The latest version of LaTeX2RTF
 is available at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a> and &mdash; with some delay &mdash; on
CTAN sites: e.g., <a href="http://www.dante.de">http://www.dante.de</a> or <a href="http://www.ctan.org">http://www.ctan.org</a>.

   <p>The MS-DOS version (1.8aa and up) will also run under all MS Windows versions. It requires
an i386 processor or better.

   <p>The Win32 distribution (starting from LaTeX2RTF
 1.9.15) is the MS-DOS version
plus Win32 GUI program (l2rshell).

   <p>There are a couple of people working on the LaTeX2RTF
, coordinated by
Wilfried Hennings (W.Hennings "at" fz-juelich.de). 
See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a>
project pages for the latest news.

<h3 class="section">2.3 UNIX</h3>

<p>To install,
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Edit <span class="file">Makefile</span> for your local configuration.  In particular, pay attention
to the <span class="env">PREFIX</span> variable.  If you do not have root access you might wish
to set the makefile variable <span class="env">PREFIX</span> to be your home directory.

     <p>On some machines the cc compiler will issue errors. Therefore the
default compiler command in the Makefile is <code>CC=gcc</code>.

     <li>As of version 1.9.13, LaTeX2RTF
 supports conversion of LaTeX
 equations to
bitmaps using the shell script <span class="file">latex2png</span>, found in <span class="file">scripts/</span>. 
<span class="file">latex2png</span> requires that
both LaTeX
 and <span class="file">ImageMagick</span> are installed. 
LaTeX2RTF
 will translate documents without a working <span class="file">latex2png</span>, but some
features will be missing.  You can verify that the <span class="file">latex2png</span> script
is working by typing <code>make</code> in the <span class="file">scripts/</span> directory.

     <li><code>make</code>

     <p>If this is not your first time installation, you may want to preserve
  your old configuration (<span class="file">*.cfg</span>) files. Copy them to a safe place before
  installing.

     <p>On IBM AIX, the IBM make utility does not support some of the commands
used in Makefile. In this case use <code>gmake</code> (from GNU) instead.

     <p>Sun has decided to support the XPG4 standard on Solaris by an
alternative set of binaries.  So allow bitmap conversion of equations, two
things are needed.  First, change the first line of latex2png to <code>#!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh</code>
Second, define the XPG4_GREP environment variable accordingly,
for bash-like shells <code>XPG4_GREP=/usr/xpg4/bin/grep; export XPG4_GREP</code> or
for tsch-like shells <code>setenv XPG4_GREP /usr/xpg4/bin/grep</code>.

     <li><code>make install</code>

     <p>If your <code>mkdir</code> doesn't support the <span class="option">-p</span> option, then create
  the necessary directories by hand and remove the option from the <code>$MKDIR</code> variable. 
  If you have other problems, just copy <span class="file">latex2rtf</span> and <span class="file">latex2png</span> to
  a binary directory, and move the contents of the <span class="file">cfg/</span> directory to
  the location specified by <code>$CFG_INSTALL</code>.

     <li><code>make check</code>

     <p>[OPTIONAL] This tests LaTeX2RTF
 on a variety of LaTeX
 files.  Expect
a whole lot of warnings, but no outright errors. (On IBM AIX, use <code>gmake check</code>.) 
Note that this will check the basic functionality of the <span class="file">latex2png</span>
script, and then that of <span class="file">latex2rtf</span>.

     <li><code>make install-info</code>

     <p>[OPTIONAL] This installs <span class="file">.info</span> files for use with the <code>info</code>
program.

        </ol>

   <p>You no longer need to define the environment variable <span class="env">RTFPATH</span>. This
is only necessary if you move the directory containing the <span class="file">.cfg</span> files. 
Just define <span class="env">RTFPATH</span> to be the path to the new location.

<h3 class="section">2.4 DOS or Windows</h3>

<p>The <acronym>UNIX</acronym> and Mac distributions do not contain an executable for DOS
or Windows. Instead, get the DOS port as file <span class="file">latex2rtf-x.x.x_dos.zip</span>
or the Windows (Win32 = Win95, Win98, WinME, WinNT, Win2000, WinXP) version as
file <span class="file">latex2rtf-x.x.x_win.exe</span> (where x.x.x is the version number) from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a><br>

   <p>The DOS distribution contains a precompiled executable which should run
under plain DOS and also in the command prompt (or "console")
of any MS Windows system.<br>

   <p>The Win32 version starting from 1.9.14a has the same executable but
additionally an optional Win32 GUI interface (LaTeX2RTF Shell)
and is wrapped in an automatic installer, See <a href="#Win32-systems">Win32 systems</a>.<br>

   <p>To install latex2rtf, extract all files from the zip archive to <span class="file">C:\l2r</span>
or to another folder (i.e. directory) of your choice,
preserving the folder structure (winzip: check "use folder names").<br>
If you extracted them to another folder (e.g. <span class="file">C:\Program Files\l2r</span>),
edit the files <span class="file">L2R.BAT</span>, <span class="file">L2RSEM.BAT</span> and <span class="file">L2RPREP.BAT</span>
and change the folder <span class="file">C:\l2r</span> to where you put them. 
If there is a blank in any of the folder names
(as in e.g. "Program Files"), then you need to enclose both
the file-ID and the cfg path in double quotes, e.g. <br>
<span class="file">"C:\Program Files\l2r\latex2rt" -P "C:\Program Files\l2r\cfg" %1 %2 ...</span><br>
or use the DOS filename equivalent instead, e.g. <br>
<span class="file">C:\Progra~1\l2r\latex2rt -P C:\Progra~1\l2r\cfg %1 %2 ...</span>

   <p>If you install LaTeX2RTF
 under WinNT, Win2000 or WinXP and
you want other users to be able to use LaTeX2RTF
, you must assign the
files and folders appropriate user permissions (at least read &amp; execute). 
If you don't know about user permissions, put LaTeX2RTF
 into
<span class="file">C:\Program Files\l2r</span> or what else the standard folder
for installing applications is named (e.g. in the German version it
is <span class="file">C:\Programme\l2r</span>).

   <p>Make sure that the folder containing the file
<span class="file">L2RPREP.BAT</span>
is in your search path, or put this file into a folder
which is in your search path (e.g. <span class="file">C:\Windows</span>).<br>
To display the current search path, enter <span class="file">path</span>
from the command prompt (with no arguments).

   <p>To add a folder &ndash; e.g. C:\l2r &ndash; to the search path:
     <ul>
<li>DOS, Win3.1, Win95, Win98, WinME
          <ul>
<li>Open the file <span class="file">C:\Autoexec.bat</span> either with Edit (DOS) or
with Notepad (Windows). 
<li>At the end of that file, add the line <br>
<span class="file">PATH=C:\l2r;%PATH%</span>
<li>Save the file to its original location. 
</ul>
     <li>WinNT, Win2000, WinXP
          <ul>
<li>Right-click "My Computer" (German: "Arbeitsplatz"), then select "Properties";
<li>NT: Click the "Environment" tab;<br>
XP: Click the "Extended" tab, then the "Environment variables" button;
<li>Find the line beginning with <span class="file">PATH=</span> and insert the string <br>
<span class="file">C:\l2r;</span><br>
so that the complete line looks like <br>
<span class="file">PATH=C:\l2r;C:\WINDOWS;...</span>
<li>Click "OK"
</ul>
     </ul>

   <p>To start the program under Windows, <br>
open a command prompt (or console window)<br>
&ndash; under DOS you are already at the command prompt &ndash;,<br>
use <span class="file">cd &lt;folder&gt;</span> to make the folder with your TeX files the
current folder, <br>
then enter either <span class="file">L2R &lt;filename&gt; &lt;options&gt;</span>
or <span class="file">L2RSEM &lt;filename&gt; &lt;options&gt;</span> <br>
where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of your TeX file without the .tex extension.<br>
<span class="file">L2R.BAT</span> and <span class="file">L2RSEM.BAT</span> only differ in the character being used
as parameter separator in the EQ fields, see chapter <a href="#Equations">Equations</a>.

   <p>If your LaTeX
 document refers to external graphic files, e.g. eps,
or you want to use the option to convert equations to bitmaps (-M# where
# is greater than 3), you must have TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript installed. 
These programs are freely available for download at <a href="http://www.miktex.org/">http://www.miktex.org/</a>,
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">http://www.imagemagick.org</a> and <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com">http://www.ghostscript.com</a>. 
This works only on win32 systems (Win95, Win98, WinME, WinNT4, Win2000, WinXP)
because ImageMagick is available only for win32, not for pure DOS.

   <p>Either the folders where TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed
must be in your search path, or you must edit the file <span class="file">L2RPREP.BAT</span>,
ensure that the pathes in this file point to the folders where
TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed on your machine,
and call <span class="file">L2RPREP</span> once after opening your command prompt window and
before calling <span class="file">l2r</span>, <span class="file">l2rsem</span> or <span class="file">latex2rt</span>. 
Under Windows you can create another command prompt link in which you
can include the call to <span class="file">L2RPREP.BAT</span>.

   <p>LaTeX2RTF
 first writes a temporary .tex file to disk which consists of only
the equation to be converted. It then sends the call for latex2pn.bat to
the operating system. There were problems that this didn't work although
manually calling latex2pn.bat from the command prompt worked.<br>
There were several bugs in interfacing between Windows XP and DJGPP which
finally caused this. One fix needed was truncating the filename of
<span class="file">latex2png.bat</span> to the DOS convention of 8.3 characters so that it is
now named <span class="file">latex2pn.bat</span> and the executable program <span class="file">latex2rt.exe</span>. 
The other fix is now hardcoded in latex2rt.exe, making sure the DOS environment
space in which latex2pn.bat is executed is large enough to store the needed
variables.

<h3 class="section">2.5 Win32 systems</h3>

<p>To install LaTeX2RTF
 on a Win32 system (Win9x, WinME, WinNT, Win2000, WinXP),
download and execute the <span class="file">latex2rtf-x.x.x_win.exe</span>
(where x.x.x is the version number) and follow the instructions.

   <p>To start the program double-click the LaTeX2RTF
 icon,
or drag and drop a <span class="file">.tex</span> file onto the icon.

   <p>If your LaTeX
 document refers to external graphic files, e.g. eps,

<p>If you want a MacOS X version, make sure that you have installed the developer tools CD
that is appropriate for your OS version, and then follow the directions above for
<acronym>UNIX</acronym> installation.

   <p>There is a classic MacOS PPC port of the 1.9k of LaTeX2RTF
 and I have made a binary
distribution of this application.  Unfortunately, because I (Scott Prahl) do all
development under MacOS X, the binaries for the Classic version often lag (far) behind the
current <acronym>UNIX</acronym> version.

   <p>To convert a LaTeX
 file, just drag the file onto the LaTeX2RTF
 application icon.  The
translation is best if there are <span class="file">.aux</span> and <span class="file">.bbl</span> files in the same folder as
the <span class="file">.tex</span> file to be converted.  These should be generated using LaTeX
 and
<span class="file">bibtex</span>.

<p>The code for LaTeX2RTF
 is standard <acronym>ANSI</acronym> C.  Some possible pitfalls
are
     <ul>
<li>Not correctly defining your compiler in the Makefile. 
The default is to use <code>gcc</code>.

     <li>Encountering errors because the compiler options.  During development
all compiler warnings are turned on.  However, different compilers have
different interpretations of <span class="option">-Wall</span> and
may generate errors that were not found in a different development
system.  Please report these, but a quick fix is to remove all compiler
options.

<p>All the files in the <span class="file">test</span> directory are converted (with varying degrees

 and are tested before most CVS check-ins and with
all released tarballs.  There will be many warning messages, but there should
be no actual error messages.  If you do not have a working latex2png script, then
some of the files will fail to be translated.

<h3 class="section">3.1 General Assumptions</h3>

<p>LaTeX2RTF
 assumes that the <span class="file">.tex</span> file you want to convert is a valid
LaTeX
 document.  The chances of a successful LaTeX2RTF
 conversion are slightly better than the
proverbial snowball's if the <span class="file">.tex</span> file doesn't <code>latex</code> properly.  Use
LaTeX
 to find and correct errors before using LaTeX2RTF
.

<p>To correctly convert font names you must edit the <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span> configuration file. 
This file is used to specify the needed font names and how the LaTeX
 default font names
should be converted to RTF.  See <a href="#Font-Configuration">Font Configuration</a>. LaTeX
 variables and user
defined commands are not evaluated. They will be simply ignored. To let LaTeX2RTF
 know the
names of variables you can add them in the <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span> file.  See <a href="#Ignore-Command">Ignore Command</a>.

   <p>The environment variable RTFPATH may contain a search path for the support files (all
files ending in <span class="file">.cfg</span>). If no file is found during the search in the search-path or
if the environment variable is not set, the compiled-in default for the configuration-file
directory is used. If the files are not found at all the program aborts.

   <p>In the MS-DOS version the search path is separated by `;' in the Unix version by `:'. For
the paths themselves apply `\' and `/'. A separator may appear at the beginning or ending
of RTFPATH.

   <p>Make sure that the configuration files are in the correct directory. LaTeX2RTF
 will need at
least <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span>, <span class="file">direct.cfg</span>, <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span>, <span class="file">english.cfg</span>. You may
have to change one ore more of them to suit your needs. See <a href="#Configuration">Configuration</a>.

<h3 class="section">3.2 LaTeX2RTF Options</h3>

<p>The LaTeX2RTF
 command converts a LaTeX
 file into RTF text format. The text and
much of the formatting information is translated to RTF making the new file
look similar to the original.  The command line syntax is:

<pre class="example">     latex2rtf [-options] inputfile.[tex]
</pre>
   <p>The <code>-options</code> may consist of one or more of the following

     <dl>
<dt><code>-a auxfile</code><dd>specify an <span class="file">.aux</span> file (for table and figure references) that
differs from <span class="file">inputfile.aux</span>. If this is omitted, the name of the
inputfile with the suffix replaced <span class="file">.aux'</span>will be taken.  You must
provide both files (<span class="file">.tex</span> and the <span class="file">.aux</span>) to be able to
convert cross-references in a LaTeX
 file.  The <span class="file">.aux</span> is created
by running the <span class="file">inputfile.tex</span> through <code>latex</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-b bblfile</code><dd>Unless an <span class="file">bblfile</span> is specified with the <code>-b</code> option, LaTeX2RTF
 uses a
<span class="file">inputfile.bbl</span>.  The <span class="file">bblfile</span> file is used for citations and is typically
created by running <span class="file">inputfile.aux</span> through <span class="file">bibtex</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-C codepage</code><dd>used to specify the character set (code page) used in the LaTeX
 document. This is only
important when non-ansi characters are included in the LaTeX
 document. Typically this
is done in a LaTeX2e
 file by using <code>\usepackage[codepage]{inputenc}</code> This command
is not needed if the above command is already in the LaTeX2e
 file.  You may select any
of the following code pages: ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865,
decmulti, cp1250, cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9, next.  The
default behavior is to use ansinew (code page 1252).  Cyrillic support includes
conversion of koi8-r, koi8-u, cp1251, cp855, cp866, maccyr, and macukr encodings.

     <br><dt><code>-d debug_level</code><dd>The <span class="option">-d</span> option determines the amount of debugging information to send to
stderr while translating. debug_level=0 means only Errors, `1' Warning Messages
(default) also.  The debug_level can go as high as `7' for insane amounts of
debugging fun.

     <br><dt><code>-D dots_per_inch</code><dd>used to specify the number of dots per inch for equations converted to bitmaps. 
This value is also used when picture environments are converted to bitmaps as well
as when EPS graphics are converted to png files.  The default value is 300 dots per
inch.

     <br><dt><code>-f#</code><dd>where # selects which fields to use during conversion:
          <dl>
    <dt><code>-f0</code><dd>    do not use fields in RTF.  This is handy when primitive RTF
    editors are being used to view the RTF output. 
    <br><dt><code>-f1</code><dd>    use fields for equations but not <code>\ref</code> and <code>\cite</code>. 
    <br><dt><code>-f2</code><dd>    use fields for <code>\ref</code> and <code>\cite</code> but not equations.  This
    will be useful for versions of OpenOffice that import cross-references
    properly (as of Sept 2003 in a soon-to-be released version) but do not properly
    handle fields in equations. 
    <br><dt><code>-f3</code><dd>    use fields when possible.  This is the default and is most useful when
    the RTF file is being exported to be used in Word.  This retains the most
    information from the original LaTeX
 file. 
    </dl>

     <br><dt><code>-F</code><dd>use LaTeX to create bitmaps for all figures.  This may help when figures are
not translated properly with the default settings.  This typically requires
a functional version of ImageMagick on your machine to work properly.

     <br><dt><code>-h</code><dd>a short usage description

     <br><dt><code>-i language</code><dd>used to set the idiom or language used by the LaTeX
 document.  Typically, this is
specified in a LaTeX2e
 document by including <code>\usepackage[language]{babel}</code> where
<code>language</code> is one of the languages supported by the <code>babel</code> package.   All
languages listed in the babel system are supported so far as translations for &ldquo;Chapter,&rdquo;
&ldquo;References,&rdquo; and the like.  Furthermore, some commands found in the style files for
german, french, russian, and czech style
are supported. See <a href="#Language-Configuration">Language Configuration</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-l</code><dd>same as <span class="option">-i latin1</span> (Note that the default behavior is to use <span class="option">ansinew</span>
which is a superset of <span class="option">latin1</span>). Included for
backwards compatibility.

     <br><dt><code>-M#</code><dd>where # selects the type of equation conversion.  Use
          <dl>
    <dt><code>-M1</code><dd>    convert displayed equations to RTF
    <br><dt><code>-M2</code><dd>    convert inline equations to RTF
    <br><dt><code>-M4</code><dd>    convert displayed equations to bitmap
    <br><dt><code>-M8</code><dd>    convert inline equations to bitmap
    <br><dt><code>-M16</code><dd>    insert Word comment field that contains the original equation text
    </dl>
     These switches can be added together to get the desired conversion.  Handy examples are
          <dl>
    <dt><code>-M3</code><dd>    convert both inline and displayed equations to RTF (default)
    <br><dt><code>-M6</code><dd>    convert inline equations to RTF and displayed equations to bitmaps
    <br><dt><code>-M12</code><dd>    convert both inline and displayed equations to bitmaps
    </dl>
     Bitmap conversion requires that you have installed a working latex2png script. 
Producing bitmaps is slow.

     <br><dt><code>-o outputfile</code><dd>Unless an <span class="file">outputfile</span> is specified with the <code>-o</code> option, the resulting RTF
filename is formed by removing <span class="file">.tex</span> from the <span class="file">inputfile</span> and appending
<span class="file">.rtf</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-p</code><dd>Do not quote printed parentheses in mathematical formulas, as some versions of
Word (e.g., Word 2000) have deep psychological problems with EQ fields using quoted parentheses. 
If Word displays some formulas with parentheses as &ldquo;Error!&rdquo;, try this option. 
See also the -S option.

     <p>This is an option because it will break typesetting equations with non-matching
parentheses (because an unmatched unquoted parenthesis would terminate the field).

     <br><dt><code>-P /path/to/cfg</code><dd>used to specify the directory that contains the <code>.cfg</code> files

     <br><dt><code>-S</code><dd>used to specify that semicolons should be used to separate arguments in RTF fields
(instead of commas).  Typically this is needed when the machine that opens the RTF file
has a version of Windows that uses `,' for decimal points.

     <br><dt><code>-V</code><dd>prints version information on standard output and exits.

     <br><dt><code>-W</code><dd>includes warnings directly in the RTF file

     <br><dt><code>-Z#</code><dd>add the specified number of extra <code>}</code> to the end of the RTF file.  This
is useful for files that are not cleanly converted by LaTeX2RTF
.

   </dl>

   <p>With no arguments other than switches starting with a &ldquo;-&rdquo;,
LaTeX2RTF
 acts as a filter, i.e., it reads from <code>stdin</code> and writes to <code>stdout</code>. 
In addition, diagnostic messages are sent to <code>stderr</code>. If these standard
channels are not redirected using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>, then the
input is read from the command line, and both output and error
messages are printed on the screen.

   <p>If a non-switch argument is present, LaTeX2RTF
 assumes it is the name of
the input file. The file must have extension &ldquo;.tex&rdquo; but the extension
is optional. The output file is constructed from the input file name
by removing the extension &ldquo;.tex&rdquo; and adding &ldquo;.rtf&rdquo;.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Debugging</h3>

<p>With the <span class="option">-d</span> option you can specify how much processing information
LaTeX2RTF
 reports. 
If there is a logfile specified the output goes to this file. Nonetheless
Warnings and Errors are logged to stderr always.

   <p>Possible values of <span class="option">-d</span> are

<h3 class="section">4.1 LaTeX2e</h3>

<p>LaTeX2RTF
 understands most of the commands introduced with LaTeX2e
.  It supports both
the old 2.09 version of <code>\documentstyle[options]{format#}</code> and the newer
<code>\documentclass[options]{format}</code>.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Input Encoding</h3>

<p>It is not necesary to specify the <span class="option">-C</span> option if you use <code>\usepackage{isolatin1}</code>
or <code>\documentstyle[isolatin1]{...}</code>. LaTeX2RTF
 automagically detects these
packages/style options and switches to processing of ISO-Latin1 codes.  The following
encodings are supported: ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865,
decmulti, cp1250, cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9, next,
koi8-r, koi8-u, cp1251, cp855, cp866, maccyr, and macukr.  The encoding used in
RTF files is cp1252.  If cyrillic fonts are present, then these are represented
in the RTF file using cp1251 (Windows Cyrillic).

<h3 class="section">4.3 Language Support</h3>

<p>The following languages from the Babel package are supported: afrikaans,
german, nynorsk, spanish, bahasa, dutch, icelandic, polish, swedish,
basque, english, portuges, turkish, brazil, esperanto, irish, romanian,
usorbian, breton, estonian, italian, samin, welsh, catalan, finnish,
latin, scottish, croatian, lsorbian, serbian, czech, french, magyar,
slovak, danish, galician, norsk, slovene,

   <p>The only thing that these files do is to translate various words usually
emitted by LaTeX
 during processing.  For example, this ensures that the
LaTeX2RTF
 will provide the correct translation of the word &ldquo;Chapter&rdquo; in
the converted document.

   <p>You can select any of the above languages using the <span class="option">-l</span> option.  This
is not needed if your LaTeX
 file contains <code>\usepackage[language]{babel}</code>.

   <p>Encountering the <span class="option">german</span> package or documentstyle option (by H. Partl of the
Viena University) makes LaTeX2RTF
 behave like that: German Quotes, German
Umlauts by <code>"a</code>, etc<small class="enddots">....</small>  This support is programmed directly
into LaTeX2RTF
 and supporting similar features for other languages will require
patching the source code.

   <p>See <a href="#Language-Configuration">Language Configuration</a>, for details on how to write a <span class="file">language.cfg</span> file
for your language by yourself.

<h3 class="section">4.4 Cross References</h3>

<p>Cross references include everything that you might expect and then some:
bibliographic citations, equation references, table references, figure
references, and section references.  Section, equation, table and figure references
are implemented by placing RTF bookmarks around the equation number (or table
number or figure number).

   <p>Page references work but are implemented as &ldquo;warm&rdquo; cross-references.  This
means that Word does not automatically update the page references when the file
is opened.  To update the page references you must select the entire document
(in Word) and press <code>F9</code>.

   <p>Bibliographic references currently require that a valid <span class="file">.aux</span> file be
present.  This is where LaTeX2RTF
 obtains the reference numbers.  It would be
nice if LaTeX2RTF
 just automatically numbered the references when there was
no <span class="file">.aux</span> file, but LaTeX2RTF
 does not do this yet.

   <p>Footnotes are implemented and appear at the bottom of each page.

   <p>Indexing is reasonable well supported.  The simple mark-up of <code>makeindex</code>
<pre class="example">     \index{topic!subtopic@\textit{subtopic}}
</pre>
   <p>is supported.  The rest of the fancy indexing stuff is not implemented. 
The index is created at the location of the <code>\printindex</code> command. 
When a file with an index is first opened in Word, you must select the
entire file and update the page references and fields by pressing <code>F9</code>.

   <p>Currently, there is no support for <code>\labels</code> of <code>\item</code>s in enumerate environments.

   <p>The conversion of cross-references is not perfect because of the different
mechanisms in the LaTeX
 and Word worlds.  In particular, if there are
multiple <code>\label</code> in a figure, table, or section environment then only the first
gets processed.  It is also possible to confuse the LaTeX2RTF
 in eqnarray environments.

<h3 class="section">4.5 Equations</h3>

<p>There are four separate levels of equation translation based on the -M switch,
See <a href="#LaTeX2RTF-Options">LaTeX2RTF Options</a>. 
Each equation is now converted either to an EQ field or to a bitmap.

   <p>This is an interim solution (for some definition of &ldquo;interim&rdquo;). 
Ideally the equations would become OLE equation objects in the
RTF file, but this needs to be implemented.

   <p>Some functions in the EQ fields have two or more parameters with a separator
between each two. Unfortunately, the interpretation of these separators depends
on the country specific settings in the MS Windows system in which the rtf file
is opened. E.g. in English versions of MS Windows, the default parameter separator
is the comma, in German versions the default is the semicolon. If the parameter
in the RTF file does not match the Windows setting, some EQ fields are not
interpreted correctly. You can check and set the separator in [Windows control panel
- country settings - numbers - list separator]. By default, latex2rtf uses
the comma as separator. If latex2rtf is called with the command line parameter -S ,
the semicolon is inserted as parameter delimiter.

<p>There is now rudimentary support for <code>\includegraphics</code>.  Three file types
will be inserted into the RTF file without needing conversion: .pict, .jpeg, and
.png files.  EPS files are converted to PNG using <code>convert</code> from the ImageMagick
package.

<h3 class="section">4.8 Pagestyles</h3>

<p>If there is no <code>\pagestyle</code> command, the RTF output is generated as with plain
pagestyle, i.e. each page get's its page number centered at the bottom.

   <p>You must turn this off with the \pagestyle{empty} command in the LaTeX
 file if
you don't want pagenumbers. 
The headings and myheadings styles are silently ignored by now. 
The twosided option to the \documentstyle or \documentclass produces the
corresponding RTF tokens. 
Note that these features require RTF Version 1.4.

<h3 class="section">4.9 Hyperlatex</h3>

<p>Hyperlatex support is largely broken at the moment, but continues to improve.

   <p>Otfried Schwarzkopf has created the &ldquo;Hyperlatex Markup Language&rdquo; which is a
&ldquo;little package that allows you to use LaTeX
 to prepare documents in HTML.&rdquo;
It brings an Emacs lisp program with it to convert the Hyperlatex file to HTML. 
Hyperlatex can be obtained from the CTAN-sites, See <a href="#Obtaining-LaTeX2RTF">Obtaining LaTeX2RTF</a>. 
There are two convenient commands that avoid typing: \link and \xlink that
generate an &ldquo;internal&rdquo; label which then is used in the following \Ref and
\Pageref commands.

   <p>LaTeX
 makes it possible to write `\link{anchor}[ltx]{label}', which typesets:
`anchor ltx'. LaTeX2RTF
 does NOT support this aproach since the optional
parameter is thrown away right now, See <a href="#LaTeX2RTF-under-Development">LaTeX2RTF under Development</a>.

   <p>Note that you have to update your <span class="file">.cfg</span> files if you are upgrading, since
there are a lot of HTML oriented commands in Hyperlatex that we simply can
`ignore'.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Input processing</h3>

<p>On processing input LaTeX2RTF
 first converts the LaTeX
 special characters. If
it encounters one of the standard commands it is converted internally. If a
command is not known to LaTeX2RTF
 it is first looked up in
<span class="file">direct.cfg</span> and the RTF code specified there is output. If not found there it
is looked up in the section <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span>.  This file includes a lot of LaTeX

   <p>commands that do not affect the output (cross reference information
and the like), or that we are not able or willing to convert to RTF.

   <p>You can use <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span> if you get tired of seeing
<pre class="example">     WARNING: command: `foo' not found - ignored
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and you don't need `foo' in your RTF document.  It would
be nice to send your additions to the LaTeX2RTF
 mailing list for inclusion
in later distributions.

   <p>LaTeX2RTF
 accepts Unix, MS-DOS, and Macintosh line ending codes (\n, \r\n
and \r).  The files it creates are the line ending for the platform on
which LaTeX2RTF
 was compiled.

   <p>The LaTeX
 file may have been created with a wide variety of character
sets.  If the LaTeX
 lacks the <code>\package[codepage]{inputenc}</code>
definition, then you may need to use the command line switch to manually
select the proper code page. See <a href="#Input-Encoding">Input Encoding</a>.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">5.2 Output formatting</h3>

<p>On writing output, LaTeX2RTF
 generates <code>\n</code> as line ending code. 
Your RTF Reader should accept this on any platform. If you ftp your RTF file
from or to MS-DOS platforms the line ending code can be converted to <code>\r\n</code>. As
this should also be legal to any RTF Reader the resulting RTF rendering should
not be affected.

   <p>LaTeX2RTF
 does not offer a whole lot of flexibility in how files are translated,
but it does offer some.  This flexibility resides in four files <span class="file">direct.cfg</span>,
<span class="file">ignore.cfg</span>, <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span>, and <span class="file">language.cfg</span>.  These filese
are documented in the next four sections.

<h3 class="section">5.3 Direct Conversion</h3>

<p>The file <span class="file">direct.cfg</span> is used for converting LaTeX
 commands by simple text
replacement. The format consists of lines with a LaTeX
 command with backslash
followed by comma. The rest of the line until a <span class="samp">.</span> character will be written
to the RTF file when the command is found in the LaTeX
 file. Lines
starting with a <span class="samp">#</span> character are ignored. After the <span class="samp">.</span> everything is ignored
to end of line. To select a specific font use <code>*fontname*</code>, where
<code>fontname</code> be defined in <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span>. 
To write the <span class="samp">*</span> character use <span class="samp">**</span>.

<h3 class="section">5.4 Ignore Command</h3>

<p>The file <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span> is used for defining how to ignore specific commands. This
file is used for recognition of LaTeX
 variables, user defined variables, and
some simple commands. All variables are ignored but the converter must know the
names to correctly ignore assignments to variables. Lines in this file consist
of a variable name with backslash, followed by comma and the type of the
variable followed by <span class="samp">.</span>. Possible types are

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">NUMBER</span><dd>simple numeric value
<br><dt><span class="samp">MEASURE</span><dd>numeric value with following unit of measure
<br><dt><span class="samp">OTHER</span><dd>ignores anything to the first character after <span class="samp">=</span> and from there to next
space. e.g., <code>\setbox\bak=\hbox</code>
<br><dt><span class="samp">COMMAND</span><dd>ignores anything to next <span class="samp">\</span> and from there to the occurence of anything
but a letter e.g., <code>\newbox\bak</code>
<br><dt><span class="samp">SINGLE</span><dd>ignore single command e.g., <code>\noindent</code>
<br><dt><span class="samp">PARAMETER</span><dd>ignores a command with one parameter e.g., <code>\foo{bar}</code>
<br><dt><span class="samp">PACKAGE</span><dd>does not produce a Warning message if PACKAGE is encountered, e.g.,
`PACKAGE,kleenex.' 
<br><dt><span class="samp">ENVCMD</span><dd>proceses contents of unknown environment as if it were plain LaTeX

     <p>eg. `ENVCMD,environ.' Therefore <code>\begin{environ} text
\end{environ}</code>' as `text'. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">ENVIRONMENT</span><dd>ignores contents of that environment, e.g., with `ENVIRONMENT,ifhtml.' 
<code>\begin{ifhtml} text \end{ifhtml}</code> ignores `text'. 
</dl>

   <p>The types are in upper case exactly as above. Do not use spaces. Lines starting
with a <span class="samp">#</span> character are ignored. After the <span class="samp">.</span> everything is ignored to end of
line. Example:
<pre class="example">     \pagelength,MEASURE.
</pre>

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">5.5 Font Configuration</h3>

<p>The file <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span> contains the font name mapping.  For example, this
file determines what font is used to represent <code>\rm</code> characters in the RTF file.

   <p>A line consists of a font name in LaTeX
 followed by comma and a font
name in RTF. The end is marked by a <span class="samp">.</span>. No spaces are allowed. The
LaTeX
 font will be converted to the RTF font when it is found
in the LaTeX
 file. If multiple translations for the same LaTeX
 font are
specified, only the first is used. All fonts in a LaTeX
 file that are
not in this file will be mapped to the default font. All RTF fonts
listed in this file will be in every RTF file header whether used or
not.  Lines starting with a <span class="samp">#</span> character are ignored. After the
<span class="samp">.</span> everything is ignored to end of line.

   <p>To add a RTF font not
used as substitute for a LaTeX
 font &mdash; for example a Symbol font used
in <span class="file">direct.cfg</span> &mdash; use a dummy LaTeX
 name like in the following
<pre class="example">     Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.
</pre>
   <p>Make sure you use the correct font name. Take care of spaces in font names. The
default fonts are named Roman <code>\rm</code>, Slanted <code>\sl</code>, Sans Serif
<code>\sf</code>, Typewriter <code>\tt</code>, or Calligraphic <code>\cal</code>.

<h3 class="section">5.6 Language Configuration</h3>

<p>The file(s) <span class="file">language.cfg</span> control the translation of LaTeX
's &ldquo;hardcoded&rdquo;
sectioning names. 
The standard LaTeX
 styles have some fixed Title names like `Part', `Reference'
or `Bibliography' that appeared in English or German in the output with the
original versions of LaTeX2RTF
.

   <p>It is unlikely that you will need to create a new <span class="file">language.cfg</span> file. 
However, just look at one of the existing files and follow the pattern. 
The format is really simple.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Error Messages and Logging</h2>

<p>As stated in the Debugging section, LaTeX2RTF
 provides a means to control
the amount of debugging information through the <span class="option">-d#</span> switch. 
By using a debugging level of 4, you can get a pretty good idea of what
LaTeX
 command caused the problem and what line that command might be
found on.

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">Fatal error messages</span><dd>indicate a bug in the source code. PLEASE report them, if they do not
apear in the documentation. See <a href="#Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Error messages</span><dd>always abort the program and are caused by conditions that prevent
further conversion of the input file.  Typically this is cause by
LaTeX2RTF
 getting hopelessly confused by the number of braces in the
LaTeX
 file.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Warning messages</span><dd>inform you, that there is some conversion loss from LaTeX
 to RTF, or that
the output file has some restrictions on some RTF Readers. Most of these
warnings can be supressed by add the offending command to the <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span>
file. 
</dl>

   <p>Error and Warning messages should follow the GNU Coding standards, i.e. they
have the format
<pre class="example">     inputfile':line: Error|Warning: message
</pre>
   <p>You can also control the level of debugging output by inserting <code>\verbositylevel{#}</code>
in the LaTeX
 file.  This is very handy if you have a large LaTeX
 file
that is failing in only a small section.  For example,
<pre class="example">     problem free latex file ....
     \verbositylevel{5}
     problematic code
     \verbositylevel{0}
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will cause a huge amount of debugging information to be emitted
for the problematic code.

   <p>Error reporting and logging still has many inconsistencies, but it
gets better with each release. 
Don't try to make any sense in debugging levels above 4, these are for my
own delight only and can change significantly between versions.

   <p>The <span class="file">inputfile</span> may be incorrectly identified if it is incorporated
through <code>\input</code> or <code>\include</code>.  The line may be also be wrong
at times.  See <a href="#Known-Bugs">Known Bugs</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">7 History &amp; Copyright</h2>

<p><a name="index-History-of-the-programm-1"></a><a name="index-Copyright-issues-2"></a>
In 1994 the first Version of LaTeX2RTF
 was written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas Granzer of
the Viena University supervised by Ralf Schlatterbeck in a one-semester course. They
created a simple LaTeX
 parser and added most of the infrastructure for the program. 
This was version 1.0 of LaTeX2RTF
.  In 1995, work on LaTeX2RTF
 was continued in another
one-semester course by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard Trisko. The result was LaTeX2RTF
 version
1.5.  <a href="mailto:ralf@zoo.priv.at">Ralf Schlatterbeck</a> maintained and extended LaTeX2RTF
 until
1998.

   <p>In 1998 <a href="mailto:jorge_lehner@gmx.net">Georg Lehner</a> found the reference to LaTeX2RTF
 on the
<a href="http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/index.html">TeX Conversion Webpage</a>  of
Wilfried Hennings and added some functionality and took
over the maintainence of the program.  The last version release by Georg is 1.8aa. 
The bulk of development post 1.8aa was done by Scott Prahl. 
Wilfried Hennings now coordinates the development of the program and maintains the project
on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a> where there are also
(low volume) mailing lists for users <a href="mailto:latex2rtf-users@lists.sourceforge.net">latex2rtf-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
and developers
<a href="mailto:latex2rtf-developers@lists.sourceforge.net">latex2rtf-developers@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.

or
<a href="mailto:latex2rtf-developers-request@lists.sourceforge.net?subject=subscribe">latex2rtf-developers-request@lists.sourceforge.net?subject=subscribe</a>

   <p>As of October 2002, version 1.9.14 of LaTeX2RTF
 is available. 
One day there shall be a jump to Version 2.0, but this is not history but future ...

   <p>The contents of this manual were composed by copying shamelessly what was
available in the original sources and documentation.

     <ul>
<li>LaTeX2RTF
 ignores some of the optional parameters of <code>\documentstyle</code>
<li>Need to finish code page support.  Some characters that need to be
      constructed using RTF <code>\field</code> commands are not implemented. 
<li>Add the code to produce the corresponding chapter, section,
      and page numbering with headings and myheadings pagestyles. Implement
      <code>\markboth</code> and <code>\markright</code>. 
<li>To support <code>\tableofcontents</code> there would be two approaches: Transfer
      sectioning information, title text and then produce page numbers by the rtf-
      reader. Scan and label all of the sectioning commands while reading and
      then construct the sectioning information using these labels. Needs two
      passes on LaTeX
 input. 
<li>Include the GNU gettext package to internationalize LaTeX2RTF
's Messages.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The first parameter of a \link{anchor}[ltx]{label} is converted to the
      rtf-output. Label is stored to hyperref for later use, the optional
      parameter is ignored. [ltx] should be processed as Otfried recommends it,
      to use for exclusive LaTeX
 output.e.g: \link{readhere}[~\Ref]{explaining:
      chapter}. Since {explaining:chapter} is yet read by LaTeX
 and hyperlatex
      when [...] is evaluated it produces the correct reference. LaTeX2RTF
 is
      only strolling from left to right through the text and can't remember
      what she will see in the future. 
<li>The diagnostics routine does not output the correct (actual)
      inputfilename. (`.aux', `.bbl', <code>\input</code>).

<h3 class="section">8.4 Reporting Bugs</h3>

<p>Report bugs to to the bug tracking system at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a>. 
Only report bugs for the latest version of LaTeX2RTF
 that is available. 
 Please provide the following information and observe the following
guidelines when reporting a bug in the program:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>State the version of LaTeX2RTF
 that you are using.  You can get the version by
specifying the <span class="option">-V</span> option to LaTeX2RTF
.

     <li>Specify the your operating system and version. Be sure to check the file `Makefile'
for settings that may be specific to your machine, especially for some versions of SunOS
there may be settings which are needed to compile successfully. Do this before submitting
a bug report.

     <li>If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include a short
LaTeX
 file along with a description of the problem.  Isolating the bug into a small
LaTeX
 file does two things.  First, it provides a file that can be used to test future
versions of LaTeX2RTF
 and second, it certainly improves the chances that the bug will get
some attention.  Do not send me large LaTeX
 or RTF files, I simply do not have the time
to wade through large files to search for a bug!

     <li>Be patient. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I did not
write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to answer to your
question. I will, however, try to fix reported bugs in upcoming releases.
