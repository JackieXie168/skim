NAME
       latex2png - manual page for latex2png 1.1

DESCRIPTION
       latex2png -- Convert a LaTeX file to a PNG image

       USAGE: latex2png [-d density] [-h] [-k] [-c] [-g] [-m] [-H
       home dir] file[.tex|.eps]

       The latex2png command converts a LaTeX  file  into  a  PNG
       image.   The first page is translated into an image at the
       specified resolution.  latex2png can also be used to  con-
       vert encapsulated postscript (EPS) files to PNG images.

   OPTIONS:
       -c produce color image

       -d density
              density  is   the number of dots per inch to use in
              the created image (default 144 dpi)

       -g produce gray images

       -h help

       -H home_dir
              home_dir is a directory to be  included  in  search
              path  (default is directory that contains the LaTeX
              file).  This  is  used  to  create  PNG  images  in
              another  directory  (e.g.,  /tmp)  and  still allow
              LaTeX to find files that it needs to include.

       -k keep intermediate files (for debugging)

       -m produce monochrome (black and white) image
              (default)

       -v version

   EXAMPLES:
       latex2png -d 144 /tmp/file
              #create /tmp/file.png at 144 dpi

       latex2png file.eps
              #create file.png

       latex2png file.tex
              #create file.png via latex

       latex2png -H . /tmp/file
              #search the cwd for image files
