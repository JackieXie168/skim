latex2png file will convert a latex file into a PNG image.

Breaking with the unix tradition of having separate utilities for separate
functions, latex2png will also convert EPS files to PNG images.  The reason
is that the latex2png script already has the code to do this conversion *and*
this conversion was needed to support images *and* I did not want to add yet
another dependency by requiring the existing scripts eps2png or epstopng *and*
I did not want to add yet another piece that could go wrong.

By default latex2png assumes that the input file is a latex file, however,
if the extension is .eps, then the file is treated an EPS file.

There are two slightly different scripts latex2png_1 and latex2png_2.
Both require a tex and dvips.  In addition the netpbm utilities are
needed from

latex2png_1 requires ImageMagick to be installed.  The second script
does not need ImageMagick, but runs much slower.

There are two slightly different scripts in this directory.  They are
labeled in order of how fast they run on my machine.  You may use either
of these to replace the default latex2png in the directory.  This is the
script that will be installed during "make install" by the main
Makefile.

When the latex file contains the tag 'INLINE_DOT_ON_BASELINE' then a dot
is assumed to have been placed at the beginning of a latex This dot is
used to locate the baseline of the equation for alignment in the RTF
file.  This shell script will create a PBM (portable bitmap) file that
can be used to determine the height of the equation baseline
