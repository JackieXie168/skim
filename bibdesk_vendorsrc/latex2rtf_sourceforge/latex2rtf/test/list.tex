\section{First test, no text after section head}
\begin{itemize}
\item first item
\item second item
\end{itemize}

Testing itemize with internal brackets
\begin{itemize}
\item Bla {and contents in brackets} and further contents.  And make this 
line extra long so that we can see how the line breaks take place.

Yet more {\it text that should be in the next} paragraph
\item Blah blah.
\end{itemize}

 The
enumerate environment without labels
\begin{enumerate}
\item this is a frog. Here is some text so that the paragraph break after this
is more clear than it is without this sentence which of
course must be very long so that it will reach the end of
the line and I see what is happening very clearly.
\item this is an arachnid. Here is some text so that the paragraph break after this
is more clear than it is without this sentence which of
course must be very long so that it will reach the end of
the line and I see what is happening very clearly.

This is a second paragraph in this item.  It is also
very very long and goes and goes and goes and goes until
at least one line is used.

\item this is a bone. Here is some text so that the paragraph break after this
is more clear than it is without this sentence which of
course must be very long so that it will reach the end of
the line and I see what is happening very clearly.
