\section{This is the first section in file \texttt{include.tex}}
\label{section01}

Here is some text to create a paragraph or two so that we
can see if this works or not.  It will be interesting to see
if the labels work properly.  As I create these testing files
I realize that I need to add parsing support for \verb#\input#
and \verb#\include# in the getSection function.   Furthermore,
after reading the \LaTeX{} book, I see that \verb#\include# 
files will all start on a new page.  This is not the case for
\verb#\input# files.  Here is a reference to the next section \ref{section02}
in this file,
and one to the first subsection in the first include file \texttt{include1} \ref{section11}. 
This is a reference \ref{section31} to the first subsubsection in 
the file \texttt{include3} that is included by \texttt{include2}.

% \include{include1} should not be included!
