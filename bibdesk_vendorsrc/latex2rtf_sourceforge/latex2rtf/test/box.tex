This silly expression was the hardest bug to find that I have ever looked
for in latex2rtf.  It turned out to be a mistake in the PopBrace code
$$
f_i \hbox{z} x
$$
that worked for nearly every other case that I encountered.  Now I wonder
if some of the font changing problems that I had were because of this 
stupid bug...

\section{First}\section{second}Here it is
$$
\displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{x+1}} {\sqrt[3]{x^3+1}}
$$

This is an \verb#\hbox{text}# starting now ``\hbox{text}''

{\it This is an \verb#\hbox{text}# starting now ``\hbox{text}'' }

This is an \verb#\hbox{text}# starting now $x+y = \hbox{text}$'

This is an \verb#\mbox{text}# starting now ``\mbox{text}''

{\it This is an \verb#\mbox{text}# starting now ``\mbox{text}'' }

This is an \verb#\mbox{text}# starting now $x+y + (x+y) = \mbox{text}$'
