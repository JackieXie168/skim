\subsection{This is the first subsection from file \texttt{include1.tex}}
\label{section11}

Here is some text to create a paragraph or two so that we
can see if this works or not.  It will be interesting to see
if the labels work properly.  As I create these testing files
I realize that I need to add parsing support for \verb#\input#
and \verb#\include# in the getSection function.   Furthermore,
after reading the \LaTeX{} book, I see that \verb#\include# 
files will all start on a new page.  This is not the case for
\verb#\input# files.  Here is a reference to the next subsection \ref{section12}.
