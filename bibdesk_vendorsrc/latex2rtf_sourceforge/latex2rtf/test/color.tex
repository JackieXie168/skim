The color package makes a default color package available. 
The colors available with this are: red, green, and blue (for screen display) 
and cyan, magenta, and yellow (to go with black for the CMYK color model for printing). 
To make a single word or phrase in color, use the command: 

\begin{center}
\verb#\textcolor{color}{words to be in color}#
\end{center}

For example, \textcolor{red}{text in red} and \textcolor{blue}{text in blue}
and \textcolor{green}{text in green}
