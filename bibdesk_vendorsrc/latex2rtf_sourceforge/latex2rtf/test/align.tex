Here we test the center environment.  The \verb#\begin{center}...\end{center}#
sequence should allow the sans serif font to leak out into the text that follows
the centered environment. 
\begin{center}
\sf\bfseries Some \verb#\sf\bfseries# centered text --- voil\'a
\end{center}
This should now be in plain roman font with the paragraph justified.
We need a lot of text to test the justification.  A short sentence would
not really be enough.  A couple of short sentences should do the trick.
\begin{flushleft}
\sc Small caps flush left on line 1 \\
Small caps flush left on line 2 \\
.\\
.\\
.\\
\end{flushleft}
Now we only have the \verb#\begin{flushright}...\end{flushright}# environment
to deal with.  This paragraph should be justified on both margins. The next should
be flush with the right margin.

\begin{flushright}
\itshape 
Italics text flush right on line 1 \\
Italics text flush right on line 2 \\
.\\
.\\
.\\
\end{flushright}
