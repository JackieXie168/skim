NAME
       pdffonts  -  Portable  Document Format (PDF) font analyzer
       (version 2.01)

SYNOPSIS
       pdffonts [options] [PDF-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdffonts lists the fonts used in a Portable Document  For-
       mat  (PDF)  file  along  with various information for each
       font.

       The following information is listed for each font:

       name   the font name, exactly as given  in  the  PDF  file
              (potentially including a subset prefix)

       type   the font type -- see below for details

       emb    "yes" if the font is embedded in the PDF file

       sub    "yes" if the font is a subset

       uni    "yes"  if  there  is an explicit "ToUnicode" map in
              the PDF  file  (the  absence  of  a  ToUnicode  map
              doesn't  necessarily  mean  that  the text can't be
              converted to Unicode)

       object ID
              the font dictionary object ID (number  and  genera-
              tion)

       PDF files can contain the following types of fonts:

              Type 1
              Type 1C -- aka Compact Font Format (CFF)
              Type 3
              TrueType
              CID Type 0 -- 16-bit font with no specified type
              CID Type 0C -- 16-bit PostScript CFF font
              CID TrueType -- 16-bit TrueType font

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Pdffonts  reads a configuration file at startup.  It first
       tries to find the user's private config  file,  ~/.xpdfrc.
       If  that  doesn't exist, it looks for a system-wide config
       file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but  this  location
       can be changed when pdffonts is built).  See the xpdfrc(5)
       man page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many of the following options can be set  with  configura-
       tion  file  commands.  These are listed in square brackets
       with the description of  the  corresponding  command  line
