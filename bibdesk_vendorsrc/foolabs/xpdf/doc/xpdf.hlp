       xpdf  -  Portable  Document Format (PDF) file viewer for X
       (version 2.01)

       xpdf [options] [PDF-file [page | +dest]]

       Xpdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
       (These  are  also  sometimes  also called 'Acrobat' files,
       from the name of Adobe's PDF software.)  Xpdf  runs  under
       the X Window System on UNIX, VMS, and OS/2.

       To run xpdf, simply type:

              xpdf file.pdf

       where  file.pdf  is  your  PDF file.  The file name can be
       followed by a number specifying the page which  should  be
       displayed first, e.g.:

              xpdf file.pdf 18

       You  can  also give a named destination, prefixed with '+'
       in place of the page number.

       You can also start xpdf without opening any files:

              xpdf

2 ONFIGURATION_FIL

       Xpdf  reads  a  configuration  file  at startup.  It first
       tries to find the user's private config  file,  ~/.xpdfrc.
       If  that  doesn't exist, it looks for a system-wide config
       file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but  this  location
       can be changed when xpdf is built).  See the xpdfrc(5) man
       page for details.

2 OPTIONS

       Many  of  the following options can be set with configura-
       tion file commands or X resources.  These  are  listed  in
       square  brackets with the description of the corresponding
       command line option.

       -g geometry
              Set the initial  window  geometry.   (-geometry  is
              equivalent.)  [X resource: xpdf.geometry]

       -title title
              Set  the  window title.  By default, the title will
              be "xpdf: foo.pdf".  [X resource: xpdf.title]

       -cmap  Install a private colormap.   This  is  ignored  on
              TrueColor visuals.  [X resource: xpdf.installCmap]

       -rgb number
              Set  the  size of largest RGB cube xpdf will try to
              allocate.  The default is 5 (for a 5x5x5 cube); set
              to   a  smaller  number  to  conserve  color  table
              entries.  This is ignored  with  private  colormaps
              and    on    TrueColor   visuals.    [X   resource:
              xpdf.rgbCubeSize]

       -rv    Set reverse video mode.  This reverses  the  colors
              of  everything  except  images.   It may not always
              produce great results for PDF files which do  weird
              things  with  color.   This  also  causes the paper
              color  to   default   to   black.    [X   resource:
              xpdf.reverseVideo]

       -papercolor color
              Set  the "paper color", i.e., the background of the
              page display.  This will not work too well with PDF
              files  that  do things like filling in white behind
              the text.  [X resource: xpdf.paperColor]

       -z zoom
              Set the initial zoom factor.  A number  (-5  ..  5)
              specifies a zoom factor, where 0 means 72 dpi.  You
              may also specify 'page', to fit  the  page  to  the
              window  size,  or 'width', to fit the page width to
              the window width.  [config file: initialZoom; or  X
              resource: xpdf.initialZoom]

       -t1lib font-type
              Set  the type of font rendering for t1lib (the Type
              1 rasterizer) to use.  Options  are  'none'  (don't
              use  t1lib  at  all), 'plain' (use non-anti-aliased
              fonts), 'low' or 'high'  (use  low-level  or  high-
              level anti-aliased fonts).  [config file: t1libCon-
              trol]

       -freetype font-type
              Set the type of font rendering  for  FreeType  (the
              TrueType  rasterizer)  to  use.  Options are 'none'
              (don't use FreeType at all), 'plain' (use non-anti-
              aliased  fonts),  'low' or 'high' (use anti-aliased
              fonts; these two  are  identical).   [config  file:
              freetypeControl]

       -ps PS-file
              Set  the  default  file name for PostScript output.
              This can also be of the form '|command' to pipe the
              PostScript   through   a  command.   [config  file:
              psFile]

       -paper size
              Set the paper size to  one  of  "letter",  "legal",
              "A4", or "A3".  [config file: psPaperSize]

       -paperw size
              Set  the  paper  width,  in  points.  [config file:
              psPaperSize]

       -paperh size
              Set the paper height,  in  points.   [config  file:
              psPaperSize]

       -level1
              Generate   Level   1   PostScript.   The  resulting
              PostScript files will be significantly  larger  (if
              they  contain  images),  but  will print on Level 1
              printers.  This also converts all images  to  black
              and white.  [config file: psLevel]

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets  the  encoding  to  use  for text output.  The
              encoding-name must be defined with  the  unicodeMap
              command (see xpdfrc(5)).  This defaults to "Latin1"
              (which is a built-in encoding).  [config file: tex-
              tEncoding]

       -eol unix | dos | mac
              Sets  the  end-of-line  convention  to use for text
              output.  [config file: textEOL]

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.   Pro-
              viding  this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -fullscreen
              Open xpdf in a full-screen mode, useful for presen-
              tations.   You may also want to specify '-bg black'

              (or similar) with this.  (There is currently no way
              to  switch  between window and full-screen modes on
              the fly.)

       -remote name
              Start/contact xpdf  remote  server  with  specified
              name (see the REMOTE SERVER MODE section below).

       -reload
              Reload  xpdf  remote  server  window  (with -remote
              only).

       -raise Raise  xpdf  remote  server  window  (with  -remote
              only).

       -quit  Kill xpdf remote server (with -remote only).

       -cmd   Print  commands  as  they're  executed  (useful for
              debugging).  [config file: printCommands]

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.  [config  file:
              errQuiet]

       -cfg config-file
              Read  config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the sys-
              tem-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.   (-help  and  --help  are
              equivalent.)

       Several  other  standard X options and resources will work
       as expected:

       -display display
              [X resource: xpdf.display]

       -fg color
              (-foreground   is   equivalent.)    [X    resource:
              xpdf*Foreground]

       -bg color
              (-background    is   equivalent.)    [X   resource:
              xpdf*Background]

       -font font
              (-fn is equivalent.)  [X resource: xpdf*fontList]

       The color and font options only affect the user  interface
       elements, not the PDF display (the 'paper').

       The  following X resources do not have command line option
       equivalents:

       xpdf.viKeys
              Enables the 'h', 'l', 'k' and 'j'  keys  for  left,
              right, up, and down scrolling.

2 CONTROLS

   On-screen controls, at the bottom of the xpdf window
       left/right arrow buttons
              Move to the previous/next page.

       double left/right arrow buttons
              Move backward or forward by ten pages.

       dashed left/right arrow buttons
              Move backward or forward along the history path.

       'Page' entry box
              Move  to  a specific page number.  Click in the box
              to activate it, type  the  page  number,  then  hit
              return.

       zoom popup menu
              Change  the zoom factor (see the description of the
              -z option above).

       binoculars button
              Find a text string.

       print button
              Bring up a dialog for generating a PostScript file.
              The  dialog  has  options  to  set  the pages to be
              printed and the PostScript  file  name.   The  file
              name  can  be  '-' for stdout or '|command' to pipe
              the PostScript through a command, e.g., '|lpr'.

       '?' button
              Bring up the 'about xpdf' window.

       link info
              The space between the '?'  and  'Quit'  buttons  is
              used to show the URL or external file name when the
              mouse is over a link.

       'Quit' button
              Quit xpdf.

   Menu
       Pressing the right mouse button will  post  a  popup  menu
       with the following commands:

       Open...
              Open a new PDF file via a file requester.

       Open in new window...
              Create  a  new window and open a new PDF file via a
              file requester.

       Reload Reload the current PDF file.  Note that  Xpdf  will

              reload  the file automatically (on a page change or
              redraw) if it has changed since it was last loaded.

       Save as...
              Save the current file via a file requester.

       Rotate counterclockwise
              Rotate the page 90 degrees counterclockwise.

       Rotate clockwise
              Rotate  the  page  90  degrees  clockwise.  The two
              rotate commands  are  intended  primarily  for  PDF
              files  where the rotation isn't correctly specified
              in the file, but they're  also  useful  if  your  X
              server doesn't support font rotation.

       Close  Close the current window.  If this is the only open
              window, the document is closed, but the  window  is
              left  open  (i.e.,  this  menu  command  won't quit
              xpdf).

       Quit   Quit xpdf.

   Text selection
       Dragging the mouse with the left  button  held  down  will
       highlight  an  arbitrary  rectangle.  Any text inside this
       rectangle will be copied to the X selection buffer.

   Links
       Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the  link's  destina-
       tion.   A link to another PDF document will make xpdf load
       that document.  A 'launch' link to an  executable  program
       will  display a dialog, and if you click 'ok', execute the
       program.  URL links call an external command (see the  WEB
       BROWSERS section below).

   Panning
       Dragging  the  mouse with the middle button held down pans
       the window.

   Key bindings
       o      Open a new PDF file via a file requester.

       r      Reload the current PDF file.  Note that  Xpdf  will
              reload  the file automatically (on a page change or
              redraw) if it has changed since it was last loaded.

       control-L
              Redraw the current page.

       control-W
              Close the current window.

       f or control-F
              Find a text string.

       control-G
              Find next occurrence.

       control-P
              Print.

       n      Move  to  the next page.  Scrolls to the top of the
              page, unless scroll lock is turned on.

       p      Move to the previous page.  Scrolls to the  top  of
              the page, unless scroll lock is turned on.

       <Space> or <PageDown> or <Next>
              Scroll down on the current page; if already at bot-
              tom, move to next page.

       <Backspace> or <Delete> or <PageUp> or <Previous>
              Scroll up on the current page; if already  at  top,
              move to previous page.

       v      Move forward along the history path.

       b      Move backward along the history path.

       <Home> Scroll to top of current page.

       <End>  Scroll to bottom of current page.

       control-<Home>

       arrows Scroll the current page.

       g      Activate  the page number text field ("goto page").

       0      Set the zoom factor to zero (72 dpi).

       +      Zoom in (increment the zoom factor by 1).

       -      Zoom out (decrement the zoom factor by 1).

       z      Set the zoom factor to 'page' (fit page to window).

       w      Set  the  zoom factor to 'width' (fit page width to
              window).

       q      Quit xpdf.

2 WEB_BROWSERS

       If  you  want  to  run xpdf automatically from netscape or
       mosaic (and probably other browsers) when you click  on  a
       link to a PDF file, you need to edit (or create) the files
       .mime.types and  .mailcap  in  your  home  directory.   In
       .mime.types add the line:

              application/pdf pdf

       In .mailcap add the lines:

              # Use xpdf to view PDF files.
              application/pdf; xpdf -q %s

       Make sure that xpdf is on your executable search path.

       When you click on a URL link in a PDF file, xpdf will exe-
       cute the command specified by the urlCommand  config  file
       option, replacing an occurrence of '%s' with the URL.  For
       example, to call netscape with the URL, add this  line  to
       your config file:

              urlCommand "netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"

2 REMOTE_SERVER_MODE

       Xpdf  can be started in remote server mode by specifying a
       server name (in addition to the file name  and  page  num-
       ber).  For example:

              xpdf -remote myServer file.pdf

       If  there is currently no xpdf running in server mode with
       the name 'myServer', a new xpdf window will be opened.  If
       another command:

              xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 9

       is  issued,  a  new  copy  of  xpdf  will  not be started.
       Instead, the first xpdf (the server) will load another.pdf
       and display page nine.  If the file name is the same:

              xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 4

       the xpdf server will simply display the specified page.

       The -raise option tells the server to raise its window; it
       can be specified with or without a file name and page num-
       ber.

       The  -quit option tells the server to close its window and
       exit.

2 XIT_CODE

       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
