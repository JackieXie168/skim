NAME
       pdfimages - Portable Document Format (PDF) image extractor
       (version 2.01)

SYNOPSIS
       pdfimages [options] PDF-file image-root

DESCRIPTION
       Pdfimages saves images from  a  Portable  Document  Format
       (PDF)  file  as  Portable  Pixmap  (PPM),  Portable Bitmap
       (PBM), or JPEG files.

       Pdfimages reads the PDF file, scans  one  or  more  pages,
       PDF-file,  and  writes one PPM, PBM, or JPEG file for each
       image, image-root-nnn.xxx, where nnn is the  image  number
       and xxx is the image type (.ppm, .pbm, .jpg).

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Pdfimages reads a configuration file at startup.  It first
       tries to find the user's private config  file,  ~/.xpdfrc.
       If  that  doesn't exist, it looks for a system-wide config
       file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but  this  location
       can   be  changed  when  pdfimages  is  built).   See  the
       xpdfrc(5) man page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many of the following options can be set  with  configura-
       tion  file  commands.  These are listed in square brackets
       with the description of  the  corresponding  command  line
       option.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to scan.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to scan.

       -j     Normally,  all  images  are  written  as  PBM  (for
              monochrome  images)  or  PPM  (for   non-monochrome
              images)  files.   With  this  option, images in DCT
              format are saved as JPEG files.  All non-DCT images
              are saved in PBM/PPM format as usual.

       -opw password
              Specify  the owner password for the PDF file.  Pro-
              viding this will bypass all security  restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't  print any messages or errors.  [config file:
              errQuiet]

       -v     Print copyright and version information.
