Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 2.01 - a PDF viewer for X


Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer for X.  The Xpdf
project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript
converter, and various other utilities.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* Redesigned the text extraction process:
  - process the text into "reading order"
  - added a "-layout" flag to pdftotext to switch back to the old
    style, where physical layout is maintained
  - use of the "-raw" flag is no longer recommended
* Added the -reload option for xpdf (in remote mode).
* Added support for external CID fonts; added the displayCIDFontT1 and
  displayNamedCIDFontT1 commands to the xpdfrc file.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:
